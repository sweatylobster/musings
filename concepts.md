# The problem of learning from experience.

What is the meaning of the phrase "experience is king," when you consider the Kantian assertion that all possible experience is prefigured in concepts? Or, in other words, that concepts are available before any possible experience? E.g. God. Many people learn from experience, or learn from those with experience. I'm thinking about this problem in the terms that Ronen's presented to me -- he was thinking about the problem of hanging the grow light in my 5x5 tent not in itself, but as something that Chris/Chib could help us to solve. 

We consult those with experience because their inference of effects from causes holds good empirically. Their capacity for accurate causal prediction holds good for the realm of their experience, but doesn't the language of physics make it possible to solve problems generally? My answer is, Yes, if only the problem can be stated formally -- i.e. in the form of the mathematical identities of physics. The alternative to asking the experienced to help us is to ask those questions which excite an awareness of the representations required to conceive of both the problem and its solution. 

As far as my solution goes -- I know that splitting the 20 pound weight along three beams will put a stress of 20/3 on each beam. Is it conceivable that, the weight so divided, the beams will give? No -- because both Ronen exerted ~40 lbs of force on the beam when he yanked it. The beams will not break -- so this will not be the cause of the light falling and breaking. The other mode of failure I currently imagine is that the line goes slack. With proper knots, this will be prevented. Once I distribute along the three


# The unremarkable possibility of anticipating reality. 
On the Kantian view of the conceptual unity of apperception preceding all possible empirical reality, the capacity for the mind to accurately represent to itself the behavior of nature via the regulated body of formal mathematical propositions known as physics, is unspectacular, so long as none of the propositions of physics neither contradict one another, nor contradict experience.

Is the fact that all mathematical identities admitted into physics did emerge from a contemplation of effects proceeding from quantified causes, or quantified virtues, sufficient to guard against the reasonable suspicion that there may yet be some event observed wholly unpredicted by our formal schema?

It obviously was insufficient, as the work of Lorentz and Einstein show with respect to the formal articulation of an equivocal observation in the third law. I'd like to go into more detail on this.
