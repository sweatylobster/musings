# On geometry and analysis
The ancients developed a method of analyzing shapes.
They applied this method to reason about the world.
They called it geo-metry, or earth-measuring.
The first Greek proof of the circumference of the earth is a fascinating one, and was done cleverly.
There was rumored to be a town near the geometer where no shadows were cast at noon.
He had an assistant set out to the town, and measure out the paces to and fro.
We all take the ability to recognize shapes for granted.
But only few humans choose to develop the skill of analyzing them.
Take the trigonometrical terms "sine", "cosine", and "tangent."
Who of us would be able, with just pen and paper, to demonstrate their meaning with examples?
Certainly, few of us without the pedagogical bent would even feel inclined.
Others might despise the feeling of being caught off guard, the infuriating shame of feeling stupid.
But we can't say an engineer has been motivated to pursue his profession by this shame.
If the basis of a mathematical skill is available to everybody
But it's just as obvious many of us would rather end it all than enter 
Certain contours may even provoke a feverish irrational response.
