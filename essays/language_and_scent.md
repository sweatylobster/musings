Language has a hard time with being.
Umberto Eco traces this already in Kant and the Platypus.
The following simply occurred to me.
One of the major problems of language in talking about being is that it has nothing to do with scent. 
To the same degree that we have difficulty talking of being, it is difficult to talk about scent. It's impossible to say what scent *is*.

# General difficulty of talking about being is common to all senses
Sure, it's hard to say what anything at all is, without predicates or adjectives/forms, but this is just it -- we can analyze what we see into parts.

# Sight has a unique capacity to comprehend being into a sign.
# This is common between sight and touch as evidenced by braille.
# Still there's a problem on how the blind understand objects by the qualities they give off. Perhaps this is why Homer was so good with analogy -- the deception, for him, was the truth. There was nothing other than the gestures and suggestions of being. There was nothing frank, comprehended, easily bound, etc. but the image by analogy. Analogy was the only comprehensive force. And the images were decidedly kinetic and visual. I have never seen a lion descend on a boar at a spring, but I know that this is how Hektor has to have descended on Patroklos -- it really couldn't have been put better. How am I so convinced of the way it went down, if I have no memory or experience of any of the things described? As soon as I hear the words, I protect the understanding the analogy intends. If a detractor in Homer's audience accuses him of lying, and that he doesn't speak the real truth, I, with my defensive prejudice, might say: "How would you know? You weren't there!", before my passion can subside into hypocritical embarrassment.
"Eidos" is an all-at-once which invests itself in objects. Objects unify ideas. But it seems that it's by visual analogy that we can decompose objects. 

With enough effort, a layman can reverse-engineer a complex device. He can be ignorant of the theory that has identified the bare-bones elements of function in that field. If the theory applies to reality, he grasps the necessity of their interrelation producing the output that they do, in common with the theory. In other words, he ascertains the causally necessary elements and relations by experiment. After all, if he can't find them *in the field*, they wouldn't be real to a student of the theory. That is, we come to know the logic of the device through its structures, and their relationships. The relationships are themselves made into signs. 

The blind use braille to read signs, and not audio recordings. 
This compels one to believe Merleau-Ponty's claim in Cezanne's Doubt, that sight and touch are the same sense in the abstract. Braille literacy for the sightless is still widely emphasized, though the technology to make audio recordings 'accessible' is not wanting. What's the reason?
Signs are visually unambiguous. 
This is why the main cleverness with subverting advertisements involves adding ink here or there, to give the dumbass on the billboard a mustache, or a missing tooth.
To be clever with acoustic signs, all you have to do is mishear/misunderstand. Mishear, miss-here, Ms. Hier -- all of the different orthographies clearly indicate different meanings and evoke different phantoms. In fact, this is the main correction Louis Braille made to Charles Barbier's system of night-reading -- changing phonetic shapes to letters, so as to give the orthography of the word in the characters.

How is it that a blind man knows that he is touching a turtle? If he still has sleep in his eyes, how can he tell a pelt apart from an animal?
A certain amount of soberness/lucidity/wakefulness is required to properly encapsulate essences into the words that are their signs. *A* bear, *a* cat, *a* turtle.
Touch and analysis, sight as comprehensive. The sense of sight seems equally disposed to analyze a unity into its parts as it is to synthesize parts into a unity.

Though both artworks of sight
Painting and schematics might have totally inroads to being. They have different objectives. Where the painting might have its success precisely in ignoring details, and reducing the object to its ineffable idiosyncrasies, the schematic requires the greatest resolution to be cast on the details, while sometimes forgetting/occluding the whole. A painting which gives a cross-section or transparent view of a thing is an odd painting. Would the Impressionists tolerate a cross-section of an apple?

-- The logic of the strandebeest can be traced: the impulse of the wind is transferred into the wheels, which then, marvelously move the structure in a balanced way.


Touch doesn't give us a being all-at-once. Let's imagine we're blind. We have to trace out the being semantically. We read the turtle semantically. We tell apart animals from rugs because rugs don't breathe or flinch. Otherwise -- what gives the animal to the blind man? over the whole  Language succeeds in eliciting scent, is that it can point to the 



# Sound
Reverse-engineering a sound is possible, but the aspects of the sound have to be investigated several times. First, we imitate the pitch, then the timbre, then the dynamics, etc. We siege the sound with unique inquiries.


# Scent

Baudelaire's `IV. Correspondances`: That it's so early shows how crucial scent is to the project, preceding even L'Ideal, or Beaute. For a poet to talk first of the effect of scents and the senses
