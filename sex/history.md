# History as a man's accomplishment

I recently read Judith Butler 'Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory'. The essay has problems. 
 - It accomplishes in too many paragraphs what can be done with fewer.
 - Because there is no exegesis of the quotations she's chosen, the reader is obliged to intuit her implicit conclusions.
 - The practical implications of the essay are unclear. How does this affect policy? Does it care to orient itself towards, prepare itself for a political implementation? Is the personal political, or is the political theatrical? What would the meaningful interpretation of these two look like?
 - The context which authorizes 


Particular problems of the argument:
 - de Beauvoir's notion of "one is not born, but, rather, *becomes* a woman," is separated from Sartre's notion of responsibility espoused in 'Existentialism is a Humanism'. The only mention of existentialism is Kristeva's quote that 'feminism is at times too existentialist.' Once again, there's no exegesis of what Kristeva means, or even a page number for us to find where Kristeva says this. Access to the context of the argument is obfuscated, and maybe not maliciously. Still, it's pretty silly not to help me validate your argument for you by looking up your references. Clearly, they're forceful enough, compelling enough for you to quote them, and not paraphrase them. Isn't the validity of your argument, therefore, contingent upon the validity of those statements? And if the validity of Kristeva's statements depends on the context Kristeva created in that essay, wherever it is, then we would need to validate Butler's conclusion by 'importing' the context of the author she has quoted. 

For me, de Beauvoir's words here carry strong existentialist overtones. 

It's difficult to read because it isn't aggressive -- it doesn't march towards its necessary conclusion. It feels like the essays I used to write. I'd quote philosophers, i.e. famously-smart people, so that their perceived authority would be my own. Their reputation was instrumental to me to authorize my feeling, and therefore, its conclusions. The problem with this is that only *caprice* is authorized. Emotions and passions *never* lead to necessary conclusions. Anger has children of diverse forms. Stories center on the passions because man has the choice to respond to them; we would like to see how *this* man responds to them. This means that *our* conclusion because of our feeling is not supplied by the feeling itself. If a feeling had a necessary connection to a future state, heroes could not exist, could not inspire and surprise us. 

I think Butler does this in two places, once with the de Beauvoir quote, and another time with the Foucault quote. 


So the essay doesn't create a context. A context is created by means of interpretation. In the context of 

Philosophers like de Beauvoir and Foucault are quoted, but the context of the quote is not explored. Butler seems to quote them merely as a matter of convenience: these philosophers *have already said* what I want to say. This requires an exegesis which the essay does not provide. If the essay is to have an authority in interpreting the works of these philosophers, it is not provided in the essay itself. On the first page, Butler leads us to another essay on de Beauvoir, instead of performing the most economical and necessary exegesis she requires for her argument. 

What's her thesis?

It seems to be that gender is a matter of responsibility. This reconnects de Beauvoir to Sartre's 'Existentialism is a Humanism.' 

Whatever it is, it is not validated within the context of the argument, but with the authority of their fame and reputation. have already said  It neither provides a definite, systematic context in which to interpret the works of previous philosophers, like Foucault, de Beauvoir, 

## Anyway -- musings on woman. 

I think men need heroes and role models, and women don't. I mean *need* -- as in *crucially*. Man must choose himself. Women are only attracted to men who choose themselves. They do invest in men with a view to their potential, but are always tempted by the actuality of other men. "It would be amazing if he finally did invest in himself." vs. "Wow. Who's he?"

Particular men are mysterious to women. Man is obvious to woman.
Particular women are obvious to men. Woman is mysterious to man.

"Kanye had kids with a Calypso. But I bet you North is gonna be a Penelope."

Kardashians would like to be role models. But are women like Penelope ever admired? Clearly Penelope gets Odysseus at the end. But did her suitors ever want Penelope, or simply want her banquet? The former, because Odysseus comes home. The banquet is the means by which she can continue her strategy to undo the loom. 

A question for another time: What does it mean that Athena must stay his hand once he arrives home?

"Mulier taceat in mulier." Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil 

Darwin, taceat in mulier. 


Butler expresses an attitude whose interpretation is crucial: man is, resentfully, perceived to have universalized himself in the category of man that is studied in history. "Humanness is coextensive with man himself." Perhaps man requires this. More importantly, perhaps *men* require this. 

Show me a healthy man who hates heroes. 

Show me a healthy woman who needs heroes. I will show you that her heroes are men.

A man who hates heroes hates women, because he resents their ideal. He resents that he is not identified with their ideal, and doubly hates himself. He hates the height he is supposed to attain, and resents his lowness. But this pain is defined relative to the height he could attain--that his conscience will not permit him to ignore. The conscience, or Apollo, never gives the ideal. The poet does invent the ideal.
The advice to men is not to love yourself, because this has been said, has applied to women, and has not made men any more lovable. Men who love themselves are no more desirable to women after than before. Why do women want money? And why do men want money? For love. For their future. And the only real future is through mating, romance, and sexuality. Economy, cooking, budgeting, logistics, transportation, SUVs vs sedans are all after-the-fact realities. Theory can be brought to bear on those problems. "How do we get the kids to school? Who can pick them up at 3, while I'm at my dance class, and you're at work?" Etc. You can give those problems as a graph-node problem to a programmer and he'll give you some optimal solution. As far mating, good luck.
The advice that seems to work better is to have man love man. Homosexuality in Greece, in Japan's Edo period -- that man could be the erotic object for men, could be the object of desire instead of a woman, is the theme of the solution. Where de Silentio was the poet to the hero that Kierkegaard did not become, men must be their own poets.
de Silentio poet-hero -- Sappho being the poet for the hero of woman. How is woman lauded in her poems -- how does she so sweetly love women? Why is it so god damn cute? I love Sappho.
By pointing, Butler reveals more about her position than the object. The least investigation of her viewpoint yields us more than what she does with this valid, and relatively facile observation. 

It underestimates, and therefore precisely misapprehends woman in the way *she would like to be misapprehended* I simply took issue with the implied argument that woman has accomplished nothing in the meantime, has not secured her futurity. And then I realized that woman has camoflauged her development in her oppression. What if woman were constantly evolving without needing mentors, instructors, heroes, and the poets that sing their praises -- entirely unlike men? What if womankind could develop implicitly, by means of her costume? 

In other words, men point to man's nature. Women, however, constantly change -- and this is the only constant. And it doesn't *define* woman. The only thing that can be used to define woman is her sex, and this is no longer an inexorable link, sex and gender. The two terms have *already been* differentiated -- it is not a philosopher's choice to accept the meaning of the terms or not. I'm thinking of Jordan Peterson's resistance to the differentiation of the two notions -- in language, they have already been drawn apart; there's *already* a meaningful distinction, so let's deal with the interpretation of the meaning of the two terms.

As we can see in Judith Butler's
