# Scientific methods with a purport to guiding thought

Mixture of Peirce's pragmaticism, and the Neyman & Pearson testing of statistical hypotheses article. 

In summary, the principle of pragmatism is:
The rational purport of conceptions is to affect conduct.
Your conceptions matter because they change the way you act.
Act as *pragma*. The deeds done in the world change when the conceptions change.
That is --  if you're acting rationally.

The statistical side is influenced by a bit of Husserl.
Something obvious he's made explicit: 
The power of science is prediction extended to infinity.
With the revolution in 20th century physics, we realize 
The privilege of the Euclidean geometry:
 - Poincare's claim that a geometry is merely a body of customs
 - we don't do physics with Lobachevskian geometry

The consequences of this are that
what's unintuitive or inconceivable may as well be outright false.
Its meaning or sense is confused.
It doesn't lead to a clear conception of the future in advance (Vorhaben)
Which means something to me or my project (Vormeinen)

# Let's be clear about the claim to *truth* we can have, and its value
The predictive power of science is its power.
I think the appropriate terms are Vorhaben and Vormeinen -- these made by Husserl fit quite well with the way Peirce emphasizes the central role of conceptions theory of pragmatism.
By our 21st century, we have several reasons to believe that we have never been able to access the truth.
For all the power of the scientific method, we can't claim that it was due to its access to/possession of truth.
If anything, the truth is the recognition of nature in a name.
Therefore, truth is solely a function of language in its power to name.
I am only in possession of the names that apply to the world; I am never in possession of the world, or the things in it.
Chomsky interview -- babies deal with structures, not the world.


Nietzsche has already unveiled for us the historical effects of the truth-value prejudice.
That this prejudice is decisive in its historical influence shows that we are not in possession of the truth, nor this prejudice, by nature.
This prejudice must be a social-historical prejudice, and definitely not of all men.
Maybe we prefer being right *because* being wrong has poor consequences (in other words, the shame of not knowing, as an instinct, would be selected for, because lacking it was distinctively disadvantageous. But this is all reasoning from the end to the beginning. It's still ignorant of a justification, and is not a theory.)
It's hard to know where the shame of not knowing came along, or what it develops out of. What's certain is that it's as much a part of our nature as the ability to count.
Who isn't ashamed of being ignorant?
But it's not merely preferring truth -- it's on pain of error.
This is the selective force: "on pain of error."


Interpretations and mis-interpretations of Platonic zetesis.
(Did Plato have his own shame of not knowing? Cults of knowledge, whether philosophers hide anything of knowledge-value. To have power would be to have named the conceptions.)
And where should we seek for it?
Whether we can do away with metaphysics is its own problem (Heidegger's The Word of Nietzsche, God is Dead); what concerns us more is setting definitions for conceivables.
To know is to be able to recall by name.
Knowledge as a function of language.
Geometry makes use of terms in order to recall the same objects that won't change form.

We have to set up habits to confront our limitations with good humor and conscienc
But in the 20th century it was decisively shown that we don't know how to think about nature, if we're talking about what it does on the quantum level.
What isn't statistical/random/mere chance or what is not mathematizable *to us.*
Rats can't determine the rule of a prime-number maze, for example.
You can't train them to navigate it.
This is all fresh off the Chomsky interview with ML talk.
