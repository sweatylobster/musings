I really don't want to fuck Robin.

Weird candidates like this pop in to my head, but she's not a candidate at all. She's so old and spoiled and poor-Jewish. There are some gorgeous Jewish women and Robin is not it. Rescues a pug pitbull thing and has no ability to care for it or take care of it.
Not an ounce of empathy for my mother. No pathos what-woever. Waiting her turn for upstaging with pity. Dumb bitches. Not an ounce of misogyny -- just recognize what you find disgusting. Stop hiding from yourself, thank God. Overall, weird and neurotic and frustrated. Thank god she didn't have  husband or children. Good for every man who escaped that.

In any case -- she's such free and run of the mill pussy she's terribly beneath you.

Have you looked at yourself lately? Honestly and truly?

Does anyone qualify for equality of soul etc

Shut up anyway you bore yourself and not with a gentle instrument proper to you and your reasoning

Speaking of which -- why is this third dimensional stuff so complicated? 

And this typing business and dyslexia

As if you have to look at the whole thing the whole damn thyme. 

You know what you're doing wrong and you like it.

You permit yourself to knot think it through to the end.

Sub-communication with the overly conscious non-neurosis.
Neurotic etc muelos
Go to sleep so you can actually show up to work tomorrow and continue writing

The whole point of this little endeavor was to think of histories.

What they entail.


Anyway -- not gonna do that.

Selene is a mistake. A huge mistake.
Don't even pretend to be interested in her.
It's for the worst.
She's boring, for one, *and* she has no sense of humor!
You flattered her just enough to get her attention, but unless you want to face the same problem as Emma...
You clock the pattern and then fall for it...
Don't be reckless with your beautiful testicles; that's what you have the generations of mind for in video games.
Video games are there for you to be reckless.

Don't even get me started with what these impoverished spirits can do to you, simply by osmosis and contagion.
They would not even be a fraction as effective if they *tried*.
It's the most archaic parts that need to be in range.
"I'm no snail."
Well, are you or not?
How did you get COVID at all?
Kindness is for snails.
Herd animals, and herd morality.
How quickly the pathos turns into fear and resentment -- every man for himself.
The rich often can maintain this pathos and ascend through pure base ingenuity and shrewdness.
Or mere lust and knack.
Why mystify anything at all.
As if money weren't worth acquiring; the rich are evil is for those who neglect their own riches of youth, which vanish every minute in their wanton lust for bodily pleasures.
No discipline at all -- all are unwitting disciples of the fashionable thoughts of the time.
Simply the condition for breeding the herd animal via the communicable pathos.
"Pathogenes"

Anyone who cannot follow please remain lost -- en arriere et non en avant.
Mar√©cages.
Whether I'm trudging through any of this or am not just an albatross.
Or whether I've been grounded at all.
Am I not laughing at the archer?
Haunting the tempest...

It's so rare for me to write I want to put any silly marker of improvement down; proficiency in Neovim, for example. 

Let the proficiency in romantic affairs be noted in the stories I begin to tell.

And not in the fashion of our most proximate king.
