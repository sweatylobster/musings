# The problem

The title suggests the impossible. 

This is a comparison of the different senses as they relate to mathematical concepts. 
For example, Dedekind broke continuity's reliance on the geometrical intuition for its 'proof'. [^1]


## The tradition; scientific reproduction of scent; are smells capable of arithmetical representation?
To date, there are no units that describe scents.
This is important because AI receives a representation of the world via number.
This means that AI can conceive of the cosmos exactly, and in no more sophisticated a manner than the Pythagoreans.[^2] (Read Klein again, cazzo)
How exactly are perfumes reproduced?
All we need are ratios of certain scents which might reach certain concentrations.
Still, we're not saying that musk is describable in terms of certain units.
The color red, however, is describable as the 440nm wavelength of light.
Furthermore, geometry makes sense only in a 'visual' sense.
Blind men are in principle able to follow along with the Euclid audiobook.
So 'visual' doesn't simply mean observed by the eyes.
Still, the schema is interchangeable with the mental image/phantasm, because it's general and not particular.
This is the sense that eidos has, as well. It is not a particular image, but a general form for like images.

Big question: is there 







FOOTNOTES
[^1]: Dedekind's Theory of Numbers secured a scientific foundation for infinitesimal analysis. Newton's 'ultimate ratio', a relation of equality between two differing quantities, which obtains in an ultimate case, is illustrated by the notion of 'magnitude'. 

Leibniz, somewhere or other, used conic sections, and in particular, a hyperbola to establish the notion of continuity. (TO PROVE) Although Leibniz did secure the notion with a geometrical proof, Dedekind's reservations about the scientific status of continuity 

is possible without depending on postulates

of the notion of continuity. by providing an arithmetical basis for its crucial notion of continuity. by showing that continuity, the principle on which the differential calculus is founded, does not require geometrical intuition for its proof. In fact, the reliance on the geometrical intuition to furnish a proof of continuity (in turn proving the validity of the differential calculus) is the very problem Dedekind overcomes by giving continuity a purely arithmetical definition. And before I go on to elaborate on what Dedekind accomplished, I should qualify that we are talking about noeta, or mental *things* (Wittgenstein's "Dinge").
The Schnitt is a term whose rational purport is to divide the countables (be they rationals, irrationals, etc.) into two classes, those higher, and those lower. While the visual intuition assists us in determining which countables are higher, which lower at a summary glance, the meaning of the word Schnitt does not necessitate that .
