## Kant
Error of milking a he goat.
One would like to anticipate truth's paths.
See where the subterranean will surface.
Like putting a GoPro on a mole.

## La Rochefoucauld
"The truth, in whatever subject it may be found, cannot be effaced by some comparison to another truth, and whatever difference that can exist between the two subjects, that which is true in the one does not efface at all what is true in the other: they can have more or less in common or be more or less clashing, but they are always equal by their truth, which is no more true in the largest than in the smallest \[truth\]."
Until this moment, the two authors use the 
But then La Rochefoucauld applies truth to character.
He takes the virtuous captain Epaminondas -- one cannot deny "his truths."
Really, one cannot refute or deny his honors he has amassed/earned.
In this sense, they're truths.
But Virgil in his domain is no less true when considered as a poet.
Effectively, the proposition is that having a larger number of truths (indisputables) doesn't at all change the character of the true when it is observed, wherever it's observed.
The two writers agree on the seductive quality of the truth; it appears to be the same everywhere.
But now we should examine Kant's proof for there not being any truth in itself.

## Kant's proof that the truth is never separated from an object


### Translation of La Rochefoucauld

However disproportionate the beauty of one beautiful house is to the other's beauty, the beauty of one doesn't at all efface the beauty of the other: that which prevents Chantilly's beauty from effacing Liancourt's beauty -- even though it has infinitely more diverse 'beauties'/'bounties'/'delights' -- and that Liancourt's beauty also doesn't efface Chantilly's beauty, is that Chantilly has the kinds of beauty befitting the grandeur of our Sir the Prince, and that Liancourt has the kinds of beauty which fit it in particular, and that each one has it's true 'beauties'. Nevertheless, we occasionally behold women with striking beauty, though irregular, which often dissolves the beauty of the more truly beautiful ones; but since taste, which makes us very partial, is the judge of beauty, and the beauty of the most beautiful people is not always equal, if it so happens that the less beautiful efface the beauty of the others, this should be only during some moments; this would be that the difference of the light and the day would make one see more or less the truth which is in the traits and in the colors, that she (the light) would make apparent that which the less beautiful possesses of beauty, and would prevent the appearance of that which is true in the beauty of the other.

... Whatever disproportion that exists between two houses that have the beauty that fits each one (respectively), the beauty of the one does not at all efface the beauty of the other:  what makes (the beauty of) Chantilly not efface (that of ) Liancourt at all, granted that it has infinitely more diverse beauties, and that Liancourt doesn't efface Chantilly either, is that Chantilly has the beauties befitting the grandeur of our Lord the Prince, and that Liancourt has the beauties which fit it in particular, and that each one has its own true beauty. One nevertheless sees women of a striking beauty, though irregular, that often efface the more truly beautiful ones.

What is taste, then?
"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder," I type -- fully ennuye.
