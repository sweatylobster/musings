This informal essay on technology begins by admiring the technological prowess of crackheads.
Then we talk about the conditions of the crackhead's success could be specified algebraically.
The relationship between the crackhead's wager and the mathematical certainty of his success will form the meat of the essay.

The *oomph* you need to take a fridge on a bike...
What is impossible? The impossible first of all is the unimagined.
There is a mathematical description of the man's unimaginable success.
Therefore there is no mathematical, empirical significance in our doubts. 
Math speaks in no way of a right to doubt. 
Doubt itself is not involved in the acquisition of knowledge, only the accumulation of secure evidence. 
Knowledge draws inferences from secure evidence.
Doubt is never but a negative space filled by experience and desire.
Wanting and not acting  a form of anger to be imported in the moment for hopes of correction.
Therefore doubt is opposed to reality.



There is no mathematical argument for ignorance. The right to doubt is a matter directly handled by the practical execution of law's logos. the argument of the defense.
The mathematical conversion of "rightfully" doubtful
He uses decent form to lift the fridge, balances it on his shoulder, and himself on his bike. 
What are all of the configurations that are not possible? | How close is this guy to failure?

# Domestication of practically any animal
Why are these guys so adept in mastering and leashing niche animals?
Fuck it -- squirrel on a leash. 

# Dani's Example
Dani saw a lady walking her Ferret on the California capitol grass.
Ferrets, by the way, are illegal in California, yet here she was flaunting her leash prowess.

There are instances of people in general being impressed by having an animal leashed and that's solely when the animal in question is a cat. Could be any cat really; House cat? cute, impressive, you and your friends speak among yourselves and ask "how DID that guy train his cat to walk on a leash?". Or you could be in San Fran, walking around North Shore and hear what you think is the low rumble of a motorbike. You round the corner and find a man in incredibly short short-shorts  walking what appears to be  a small Puma- on a leash. This massive cat is just LOVING the attention and you quickly realize that low rumble you heard was in fact its pur. You ask to pet and shorts man gives an enthusiastic "YES" but before you can even reach out, Pepper, that's the cats name is already rubbing against your leg and lets out the deepest MEOW you've ever heard. The bass of Pepper's purr is incredible. You ask, "hey is Pepper part Puma or something?" shorts guy looks at Pepper in awe and total pride. He doesn't respond for quite sometime and finally says "yeaaaa, something like that. Pepper is a rescue, her previous owner liked to cross-breed housecats with Big Cats like Pumas, Leopards, and Panthers. Now pepper gets spoiled by everyone in 'Cisco"
You think to yourself, "goddamn, this man and his big cat sure are impressive."
