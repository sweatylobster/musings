The Two Things that Deeply Psychologically Change a Person
trauma; grief

# Trauma
So much indebtedness, rape, ignorance, abuse. My family drowns me, everyone except for Sam. Currently, Sam and Gabe are the actual ones I trust. Dad cuts me off, Mom ignores me, Andy does too. If I would withdraw, I would feel healthier. Just admitting this makes me want to cry and start 'grieving.' The word takes the tears away from my eyes but I can't believe how much abuse I've endured at so many different hands. My father's, my mother's, my brothers -- I've been needing to separate myself off from everyone for so long. 

They all think they know me. In the same way that Mom gets perceived in ways she first of all won't and only then *can't* control, I do too.

I hate everyone, really. Everyone's forcing me into being more stupid. Funny enough, Joeyy lyrics help; I'm perfect, it's on you if you don't get it, etc. Everyone's hostile to my becoming more than what I currently am; to my becoming more self-actualized than everyone else.

I was looking in the wrong place for resistances the whole time. I thought that it was my ignorance that was keeping me down. It turns out that it was my lack of control over my environment.

Every single time I tried improving others I felt squashed. This was the clue. I should've gotten my own apartment and paid for it with money I didn't have. I should've gone too hard; this has been so damaging and stunting for absolutely no reason.

Even recently with Gabe, it's like pulling teeth to talk about anything technical. It's like pulling teeth to do anything at all. It's very strange because I did everything and he needs me to do anything. We have one cert, and as soon as he gets certified, we're rolling. But we know that I'm managing all of the departments. If I die, or if I can't explain it to someone else, there's nothing at all. Total trust in me to set the infrastructure, and I did entirely alone.

I have no problem having done it alone; it's what makes me so proud of myself. It's what proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that nobody's on my fucking level -- that what I've worked so hard for and spent so long visualizing I realized with my own sacrifices -- that my visions paid off because *I* believed in them and everybody else was blind because -- they didn't want to admit they didn't understand. They didn't want to start at the beginning -- ignorance.

I'm not mad I did everything alone; I'm so proud of myself. It's proof of what I am and what I'm meant to do, how I'm meant to grow and how I'm meant to lead. Leading. As if I can fucking lead. I want nothing to do with anyone else. I need to vent my frustrations on the punching bag. Too much pent up frustration keeping me down. Explode appropriately. Vent your anger appropriately. The great man makes the release for himself.

Nobody listens; everybody just needs my fucking ears.

I hate music. I hate making my music now. I hate Dani, dude -- that fucker annoys me so much. I'm so disgusted by him and his lack of hygiene and his inattention, his incapacity to learn or grow or do anything new at all. How have I tolerated him for so long? There were so many times I wanted to cut him out of my life; he's like a growth on it. We're nothing alike. I can't be around anyone with him; he's embarrassing. It's like he's trying to weigh down as much as possible, be as un-helpable as possible, as pitiful and disastrous as possible. He doesn't prepare for fuck-all. He wants to start a project and can't fucking play in tune or practice at all. He can't be taken seriously. He wastes time and distracts himself. Is he my fucking friend? I don't want to be his friend, if what we're doing right now is being friends. I need to really cut down the amount of time I see anyone at all. I really need to ensure that I cannot be contacted by anyone except for Gabe; he's the only person that matters.

God is challenging me by putting distractions in my life. Speaking of which -- give yourself a free day and print the liens now while you get the vehicle information for Mom. Tomorrow, deliver the liens at the clinic and leave immediately.

i have to leave

i had to leave so long ago

how could i be so fooled into thinking loyalty to my own damage was good

twisting my boutons empestes

What was the point of cultivating virtues? Hitting the mark. The archer knows when he hits his mark. I've read my Dostoevsky. Apollo *is* my god. I have energy only to draw and release; my ears are numb. I don't want to do the good things for admiration; I want to do them because doing them well is what happiness is.

Remember -- anything which makes you misunderstand or makes you angry is the wrong approach. You have to grant yourself a true serenity. You are so careful of being delusional that you're paranoid. Your care against delusion makes you confide in people who haven't begun to think of trust as a *problem*. So they trust themselves and you dispossess yourself of your trust in yourself, because you believe they went beyond you. You either trust your method or not. Nobody else's trust in themselves can stand in for your own.

What dad has patience for in his best moments -- it's our prerogative to do things our way. I delivered with this fucking Python \LaTeX script and what else do you need? It was so simple, even if was so fucking exhausting. There was so much riding on it, but it was such a little script. I really think I have to be worth so much more, as strange as the victory feels to relish in. I can't decide on whether the victory is good or bad to celebrate. If it's going to make me more inflated and indolent, as I have been for the past few months -- I hope I can always hate myself and do better things. The victories mean nothing.

Seriously -- what good comes of celebrating a victory?

Right now I have to read Machiavelli and keep everything to myself. No one's Italian enough. Me, least of all.
