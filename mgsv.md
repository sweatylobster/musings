# Ides of March, pharmakoi ritual, Oedipus
In Rome, the [Ides of March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ides_of_March) are when the year's debts are paid. It's also the day Julius Caesar was assassinated.  In the Phantom Pain, we deal with the sacrifice of the son (Venom Snake) for the father (Big Boss). If Big Boss is Julius Caesar, Miller is Brutus, which makes Venom Augustus Caesar. Liquid and Solid Snake are not Jesus figures, but Solid might do something martyr-like at the end of MGS4? 

Apparently there's a pharmakoi ritual (pharmakos is a physician, or doctor) which heals the city. Oedipus is tasked with finding the cause of the miasma afflicting the city he rules, until it's revealed to him by the blind prophet, Teiresias, that he himself is the cause of the miasma. If the structure of the Oedipus story parallels that of MGSV, who is Oedipus? Big Boss is not under a deception -- it's Venom Snake who does not know himself. The miasma that infects Mother Base is brought home by Venom Snake, as he goes to the facility in Episode 20 - Voices. There is no Teiresias for Venom Snake, however, which shows the difference in the mode of revelation between the Oedipus story and the whole of MGSV. 

There is no blind man which reveals the truth to Snake. Ocelot and Miller both sustain the lie that Paz is still alive, for example. In talking about Paz, they talk about you. The place you see Paz is on the third floor of the Medical platform; you are not permitted to go down the corridor *to the left*. In PT, the player makes progress through the spiral only by making *right* turns. I'm invoking the concept of force (might is right), right-hand man, inheritance, genetic inheritance, onus/burden with the language of right, and Heidegger's "seeking the true by way of the correct" (rect, recht). At the same time, the concept of sinister is invoked.

Most people are right-hand dominant, making the left-hand gauche, or 'awkward'. In its awkwardness, it's weaker, and less capable of exercising the will, which in the eyes of the strongest, is doing right. The sinister is bad because it's the less reliable hand. Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morals shows how the ineffectual consciences are the twisted ones -- deilos, 

Book of Matthew, apparently: 
God will divide nations on the Day of Judgment "as a sheperd divideth his sheep from the goats; and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left,” with those on the right sent to the kingdom of Heaven and those on the left “cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.” 

This fits the linguistic deterrence model proposed by Skull Face
1975 is Judgment day
And the shadow of Judgment day is 1984 -- Venom's awakening

Dextrous - codex,

The [pharmakos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmakos) ritual is directly represented in MGSV. 
Under 'Modern intepretations' in the Wikipedia article, we read:

"Burkert shows that humans were sacrificed or expelled after being fed well, and, according to some sources, their ashes were scattered to the ocean. This was a purification ritual, a form of societal catharsis."

The ashes of the Diamond Dogs who died in the second parasite outbreak (in the Quarantine Facility) are not scattered to the ocean, like in the pharmakos ritual, but instead are consumed and worn as a mask by Venom Snake. Venom Snake says, before pouring the ashes out at the edge of the helipad: "I won't scatter your sorrow to the heartless sea. I will always be with you. Plant your roots in me." He then spreads them on his face, taking them as his face. "I won't see you end as ashes. You're all diamonds." Miller: "We're not burying them at sea? What then?" "We'll make diamonds from their ashes. Take them into battle with us." M: "A shining light to our brothers-in-arms, even in death."





# Reading between Death Stranding and MGSV

Anyway -- if Big Boss is Kojima's child, it takes Death Stranding's Sam Strand to deliver BB to the future. 
BB and Sam are both motherless heros. Sam is challenged to kill his mother with a special revolver inherited from Obama.
Does it take learning to read Death Stranding to learn to read MGSV? 
The villains are so straightforward in Death Stranding. 
Cliff's ultimately the bad guy, but not really -- he's your dad. 
The option to kill your mother -- the only act of murder that seems needful, to prevent apocalypse -- is useless. Your mother is immaterial. Ame lie -- a bound soul. Ame lie -- a soul that's a lie. These are *religious*, in the sense of binding together. (But where did I read recently that religious doesn't simply mean tying together? Was it Heidegger? Some passage exposed the naivete of this reading...)


Big Boss is Kojima's child, which Sam (Uncle Sam, King Samuel) must deliver to the future in the absence of a Mama, or an Eve/Eva. Mama has a phantom child that exists in another dimension, and is not, for example, subject to the laws of gravity. The child's mobile has a whale on it. Fragile can teleport herself and another person, but cannot bring your materials with you. Sam, the great deliverer, who is definitely a hero, and in some ways a greater hero than Big Boss. He strands together the stranded Americans. He forges a path to and between all isolated shelters, and overcomes terrorists and MULEs (the resentful) (using only non-lethal weapons -- we are not allowed to use incinerators; we can't clean up after our own murder, like we can in MGSV, stowing corpses in dumpsters and portapotties, or yanking them with the hand of Jehuty.), 



# Hospital in Cyprus as testing ground for English strain -- DEBUNKED
# (theory was only possible by ignorance of Ground Zeroes; Camp Omega is the training ground for the parasite.)
# Up until this time, the parasite only worked for certain ethnicities. Glaz (Big Boss) and Palitz () It did not yet have the success of the Kikongo strain observed infecting Mother Base staff. The volunteer system ensures that the player will have an ethnically diverse Kikongo-speaking population. 
In the first truth tape, Ocelot tells Big Boss that *their* plan must begin ahead of schedule, for two reasons. 1. "They found out. About you waking up. And the man on fire picked this time to wake up too." Because Tretij Rebenok and the man on fire attack the hospital together, and XOF fights the man on fire,  *and*  they do not kill Venom Snake when they turn him over in the hospital, this must be the facility that is mentioned in Skull Face's Objective -- a conjecture...etc. This is where the English language parasite was being trained by Skull Face -- totally where Cipher would least expect it.

The XOF at the hospital does not belong to Skull Face
 - fights man on fire
 - if goal is to kill all infected, they do not burn the bodies of the infected

Man on fire *might* belong to Skull Face.
  - Problem is, he seems distracted, hell-bent on getting Big Boss. Tretij Rebenok follows and animates him, who has a greater lust for revenge. Whether Skull Face is motivating this chain is unclear.


Adam then tells John Zero's plan, to make Venom Snake Big Boss's body double. Ocelot tells Big Boss Miller is preparing to move him. (It is not clear what Big Boss thinks of Miller.) Ocelot will suggest himself into forgetting Big Boss's identity, so as to truly support Venom Snake. During the mission Truth, we see Ocelot remove Big Boss from the ambulance, while Venom Snake is left suspended. (The peace sign inverted are fangs.) Zero, Skull Face, and Miller are the only others who know of the plan. Therefore, if Venom is to be the instrument of one of the members of Cipher, it has to be either Miller or Skull Face. Everybody else sees Big Boss when they look at Venom.
