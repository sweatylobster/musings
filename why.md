# Introduction

In the README, we define the entrepreneur as the mediator of skilled laborers that can be brought to bear upon his project. The operands clearly defined, to contract by a wage the appropriate operators. By a quantification of forces required to effect the envisioned product, the role of the skilled laborer's intuition is demystified. We identify this clarity with science, and even went so far as to make his highly-attuned nervous system interchangeable with a well-programmed automaton following conditional statements. Science, under this definition, was demonstrated to make a better entrepreneur, because it gave him the capacity to articulate the new-found awareness in the form: this myelinated nervous-system is not the cause; the force, in this quantity, applied in this orientation, is the cause. This science, being based on physics, as it applies to practical application, is no different from engineering. Since business is entirely a matter of uncertainties, a quantification, and confidence is wanting in all businessmen, a formal appreciation of odds of success would grant the entrepreneur greater patience in the face of adversity -- if only those formally valid predictions do have a bearing on empirical fact.

Yet, from the same source, we've also established that the entrepreneur is absolutely justified in saying: "I can't afford to spend time learning mathematics, I need to spend my time solving [what no one else can solve]." Is there not some solution? Well, to what problem?

# The singularity of the entrepreneur's judgment

For reasons accidental and deliberate, the entrepreneur is obliged to face his problems alone. Firstly, taking others into his confidence costs time, whose value is often greater than the confidant's proposed solution. If such a confidant *is* capable of counseling him, he seems either to be his competitor or advisor. In either case, the entrepreneur will sustain an injury: in the former case, to the efficiency of his business; in the latter, to his pride.

# Objective in writing

It's the aim of this article to propose a means of lessening the burden upon the average entrepreneur, in no way done by shifting the fulcrum of his responsibilities. In fact, to do so would so decrease both the gravity and dignity of the entrepreneur's station, as to make it seem identical with that of the employee's. He would be hard-pressed in such a circumstance to stave off a well-justified mutiny.

I propose, instead, a means of externalizing and emending his unique judgment.


# The entrepreneur's unique situation; entrepreneur as captain

The entrepreneur's unique share in the company's fortune is owed to his extreme responsibility over the company's fate. He embodies the apparatus of judgment in the Leviathan he has assembled, whose condition thereby determines his psychological and financial condition: as profits and joy accrue in good times, so equally does his misery and stress in those unfavorable. Because of his extreme responsibility, the weight of his conscience will compel him to close the business when it fares poorly -- for who could understand him? A man in such a desolate state wishes only to nullify the principle of the business's failure; is he not, like Job, justified in feeling this? As is only right, the business closes and the limbs seek another master to direct them. 

To manage this is required either the drunken bravado of the Winter Army (that faction of WWII which sustained the greatest number of casualties) or the terrifying calculus of Odysseus, who, as the viscera of his men plummet back out of the darkness to paint the hull of his boat with slick chunks of red, their screams reverberating incessantly throughout the cave, he regulates by his own echoing speech those still rowing, never faltering in the confidence of his choice to enter the cave, when the circumstance of which he was forewarned, is brought presently to bear upon all of his senses. 

Only God is capable of inspiring that terror in Job. The role of terror for an upright leader must be made clear before we begin, and this be achieved only by means of poetic imagination. For the pitiful, the inconsolable who do not shudder, ([deilos](https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/3722) kai adeinos), who feel no terror symmetrical in kind to Odysseus's, there is yet another method I propose. The use of externalized judgment which has anticipated loss arithmetically.

If one should doubt the value of the essentially arithmetical method proposed, consider that the warning given to Odysseus mentioned that Scylla had six (6) limbs, but that Charybdis would destroy the whole (1) ship. Had Odysseus never received a representation of the events to come, he might well have followed the calculus of common sense: " *obviously*, you stay in the light and steer clear of the cave! Are there even whirlpools that big?"

Yes. And never mind that a blind man is telling you this story.

Had this layman survived, would it not have been out of cowardice? Such a man is [deilos](https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/3722), because circumstance, the force majeure, splits his judgment in two. Upon his undignified return, would he, if able to curb his desire for bourbon and wine, not be both pitiful and inconsolable, and worst of all, permitted to be so? He is a hypocrite, who, by definition, find their highest significance in the audience's appraisal of them (under judgment/playing a part). Odysseus is not split in twain because his very commanding is the incorporation of his terror.
