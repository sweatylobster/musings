# Musings Zettelkasten

After watching Mischa van den Burg's [Zettelkasten video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIGJ8NTHF4k) and reading [Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) by Tiago Forte, [which I am having trouble finishing](#problems-with-tiago-forte), I realized this musings folder is exactly the sort of second brain proposed by the pair.
The `git log` may not show I had abandoned this musings `git` repo some time after disusing cannabis.
This new Zettelkasten directory is the revival of it.
I have a purely experimental interest in Zettelkasten.
My chief interest is to ground an analysis of the consequences of any *methodical* use of the system.
This means the analysis of many methods, which in turn entails a comprehensive definition of a Zettelkasten across the physical and digital form.

## Definition of a Zettelkasten
A Zettelkasten is a physical or digital system which indexes and links fragmentary thoughts.
It separates the typical spatial-temporal constraints of writing, which is, for example, the virtue of essay-writing.
You have to sit through and make the paragraphs well-ordered.
The, or any, sequence of thinking is not a chief mental element when writing Zetteln.
Retrieval and reassociation of the fragments is a priority of a Zettelkasten.
This distinguishes it from a wiki, which prioritizes retrieval -- not necessarily reassociation.
The contents of the system grow organically with the thinker, requiring dynamic efforts of re-organization on the part of the thinker.
to and especially its resolution of its taxa , the temporal scope of the elements must be managed intelligently.
I can reorder my philosophy using a file-manager tui, like `nnn` or `fx`.


## Caveats of the physical Zettelkasten, indexing overcoming spatial sequencing
A physical Zettelkasten requires an index to realize these priorities since it is spatially extended; there must be some card at the front, and some other at the back.
Fragments scrawled out onto 3" x 5" index cards *without an index* are useless; such a fragment-box gives only the semblance of organization.
So in a physical system, it's the index that allows for an [interior mobility](https://culturemachine.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/373-604-1-PB.pdf) the digital system takes for granted.

The two primary elements 


In what sense is a second brain a thought-factory?
How does the structure of the Zettelkasten determine the quality of the thoughts?
What is the relation of a Zettelkasten to an essay?

## Bic-style

[Latour - making of law](http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/downloads/MAKINGOFLAW-Foreword.pdf)

I find the writing on the topic deficient until it can suitably explain the following phenomena:
 - the method of composition employed across Ludwig Wittgenstein's writings, and its determination of the product
 - Roland Barthes's writings
 - Roland Barthes's writings


## Problems with Tiago Forte
Though Tiago Forte's considered an expert on productivity, I take issue with the generality of his writing.
The book *sells* the reader on establishing a Second Brain, and harps on points I'm already on board with.
I am clearly not the intended audience.
Furthermore, it doesn't address questions I'm interested in.
For example: How were Roland Barthes, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and Niklas Luhmann, so prolific?
Did they use a Zettelkasten proper, or some variation on it?
Since an argument is not merely information -- how was their method of collecting and assembling information into arguments facilitated by their particular notetaking system?
That is -- how does one get a work out of Zetteln?
What are the methods for recombination and reassociation used by the authors?
Take *para-taxis*, for example, where the notes are reclassified by placing them beside one another.
Is there a superior digital analogue to this activity?
If so, would the use of this digital practice *really* have improved the productivity, and more importantly, the quality of thought of the thinkers listed above?
Is there a benefit in the difference in tempo?
What are the parts of the mind which are used in the physical system, that are not used in the digital system?
What is the mind doing when it puts pen to paper -- to go along Barthes' lines of thinking?
Is this an essential component of practicing the thoughts?
In what sense is a Zettelkasten a body of thought?
In what sense is a Zettelkasten a *Weltanschaaung*, or *world-outlook* -- is it due to the taxa?
If it is the taxa which determine a Zettelkasten as a "philosophy" (*Weltanschaaung*, or world-outlook, really), would there be as many "philosophies" as there are permutations of the indexes?
If a Zettelkasten is a philosophy primarily based on its taxa,
In a more Borges-like sense -- Can the collection of notes simply re-catalogued
