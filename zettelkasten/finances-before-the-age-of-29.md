# Finances before the age of 29

My finances are in shambles.
Can't afford what I've bought.
Basis is risky.
I work a lot but can't get paid yet.
Become strong.

## $2400 a month

$\$2400/30_{days}$ is $80 bucks a day.
Factor in that I work weekends.
3k a month is a target at $100 dollars a day; I make 80% of that.
Now that I've said the same thing, twice, how should I use my money?

## Essentials

### Food
- 3 eggs a day in the morning
- 
### Skincare
