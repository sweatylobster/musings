# Using CAPS LOCK as escape

Using CapsLock position for escape is so far superior, as awkward as it is at the moment.
Going slow and really practicing it will benefit so much.
It affords the same power as using only one thumb to type the space character.
My left pinky doesn't actually do anything other than type a, q, or the shift symbol.
Leaning into it, muscularly & physiologically, is going to be an interesting attitude to switch to.
