Taskwarrior has both a "recur" and "wait until" field.
This makes it useful for doing laundry, or cleaning my bedsheets -- on a regular schedule.

I wear clothes every day, and yet my laundry schedule is totally irregular.

`task add +room +laundry +clothes "Figure out how many clothes I have; make a dataset and sell unwanted crap"`
