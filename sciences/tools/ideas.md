# Echo makes a skeleton key

Echo gifts a young man a skeleton key which sounds out 

Gevahlt, long presumed to be dead, surprises the king when he returns to court. His delay, after all, obliged the king to send Roland to fulfill his friend's original mission: to discern what their neighbors were poised to attack. Now arriving with the king's cartographers, Roland seals the chamber to secure a private audience with the king. Gevahlt tells of a new country, over a sea, which he discovered only by stowing away on an unfortunate, months-long voyage. 

All three countries speak very nearly the same language. 

Gevahlt tells of the trade deals between the two countries -- their rival, and the new. In large quantities, and at a very low price, the new country purchases [insert natural resource which is in abundance in the king's country; but does the spy want to tell the king? perhaps what's hidden in the vault trumps this in value.] spice. It seems, then, that the neighbors, occulting the true source of the spice (in this country) -- are poised to undermine the king to take it. 

Gevahlt finally uncovered a crypt in that country, known only to penitents of a clandestine order. A large door with a massive lock, operated by dozens of men, guards secrets of the order. Since the goods traded eventually fall into the hands of the order, the secret of harvesting the resource ostensibly lies there as well. (Because of the importance of this resource to that new country, the makeshift council assumes that there are spies in their own midst. (This contradicts bringing in the cartographers, unless Roland and Gevahlt are obfuscating details and misinforming them. In this way, the spies, some of whom would certainly be among the cartographers themselves, would inaccurately report (to the new country) the state of this country's knowledge.)

In a more private council, the king calls to order his most trusted engineers and scientists.
Even the cleverest of among them have no solutions which would work for so large a lock.
After a long silence, the court jester replies "Echo'd be right at home in there."
In his seriousness, the king does not fail to see the message behind his jester's words. 

And so the king sends the best tracker in all his lands to hunt down the long-lost Echo.
Naturally she has trained her school of nymphs in her service

It is practically a skeleton key. What's required to opena  lock is to apply force to the correct tumblers, pins. All that you need is to apply those forces. Make a device that images the lock by sense of the interference. (What is sense if not interference...)
1. Find a key mold
2. Insert the device
3. Blast a known quantity of air
4. Image the cavity by the vectors reflected back into the device
