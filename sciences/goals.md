# MY GOAL

I want to be an engineer, but my demon is skepticism. At this stage, I am so doubtful of the benefits that any study has to offer with respect to practical improvement. 




To be wise is to adore my demon as a gift (dora), since it is the negative form of my power of demonstration. Reason is a noble beast, and its dignity is demonstration; skepticism is its spur. To replace skepticism with firm audacity (avid--to want very much) resembles the field produced by the yoked ox. Every desire has its demon. Heaven or hell is the ensuing combat with the demon. The structures which appear to be the most audacious and least secure have been constructed according to demonstrably sound principle, which is self-identical in all instances of its success. This principle can be schematized by a  am dissuaded by skepticism, I will exert the power of demonstration.  Men are only incredulous of what has not been demonstrated to them. Nature is the most impressive and accounts of it are easily demonstrable. I want demonstrable accuracy of my predictions about states of a system. Forces are deduced from motions upon definite bodies.

# Newton's introduction to the Principia

"The ancients, as Pappus wrote, made mechanics of the highest importance in the investigation of natural matters, and more recent writers, having dismissed substantial forms and occult qualities, have made an approach to referring the phenomena of nature back to mathematical laws. It has accordingly seemed fitting in this treatise to develop mathematics insofar as it looks to philosophy. Now the ancients etablished two branches of mechanics: rational, which proceeds accurately by demonstration, and practical." 

# The two branches of mechanics: rational and practical

Demonstration and construction are the two complementary activities of mechanics. Pappus identified the theorem and problem as the two distinct forms which could set the activities into productive opposition, so as to yield a proof of something sought (zetetic), or a happy accident occasioned by the construction (poristic). Where theorem and problem refer to the type of knowledge attained, Book 13 of the Elements shows in immediate succession the difference between the two modes of proof.

# Ancient : modern :: mechanic : philosopher

First, we must ask whether such revolutions in mathematics as Descartes's algebra, Vieta's invention of the exegetic/rhetic mode of relating magnitudes, are of use to us in investigating natural matters, or, if not, what the meaning of philosophy after Newton should take on in our mind. Mechanics is mathematical, but not inherently one branch of mathematics. Is mathematics a ramifying tree whose tips are taxa? then obtain an account as to the power of each of the branches to fulfill the resolution of problems or theorems. Does the leaf fit? Is there any knowledge which is unique to geometrical modes of reasoning? What meaning shall knowledge take on when there is the reality of the undersatnding and the cosmos, both of which are already adapted to? There is some thinking apparatus which knows exactly what it's in -- this is not reason, and this is not me. But it makes use of me. Where I knot, it flies. What is demonstration? Same in Newton and Euclid? And Leibniz, and Descartes?

# Descartes's revolution

Descartes's geometry on first glance seems simply to assign ciphers to geometrical magnitudes. The operations In doing this it can assign ciphers to geometrical theorems. This is notably preserved in the form of a^2+b^2=c^2. This is not demonstrated by algebra. The equation expresses the general relation of parts of a uniquely defined class of a geometrical figure (Postulate 4 in the Heath translation). The use of algebra is from rational mechanics. It follows that an arithmetical evaluation of the ciphers should yield an interchangeable result to a corresponding geometrical proof whatsoever. This is to say that, if the line AB, also a, is taken to be 5 units of length, its square shall enclose 25 of the same unit. However, the results of a manipulation of ciphers is not demonstrated be, to mechanics

have to ask whether any branch of mathematics is more capable than others to furnish mechanical proofs.  The use of matrices
