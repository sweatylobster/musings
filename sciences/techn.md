What is technology? And how should we compare "our technology" to that of our ancestors?
Clearly, our situation in time is affected most closely by the Industrial Revolution. In a way, we are asking for the paternity which led to the Industrial Revolution, and influences us still.
If we should assume that man has not significantly changed in the past 4000 years, then we cannot attribute the sophistication of his constructs to a commensurate advance/evolution in his nature.
In other words, following from this premise, our brain hasn't changed in a way that uniquely enables these new constructions. 



ability to reason appropriately about the world, without having to improvise and test. 


Let's suppose that man has not significantly changed in the intervening time. Has technology, then, essentially changed? 
Let's look at architecture, for example.
The mere age of the pyramids is enough to cast a fatal doubt on the meaning of "progress."
It's necessary, then, that we don't think of the progress of technology as essential with man's capacity to adapt things according to his desire or need. 



definition of technology, and its advancement, does not make the construction of something impressive
The difference in the refinement and sophistication of the two technologies, then, must not be the product of a faculty, or bodily power which we have come to possess by a mutation, or "evolution", but would rather be the result of some mental activity.
