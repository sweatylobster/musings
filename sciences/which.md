# What is science?

A body of non-contradicting propositions about classified objects, whose truth is indicated by our senses. Classes themselves are the result of admitting the principle of non-contradiction into thought. 

# What does science do for us?

It enables inference. Give us an idea of the behavior of *this* particular member of the class. This is also called inference.

# To what does science apply?

Experience. More specifically, objects of experience. We can talk about experience (only) by means of concepts, and can talk about concepts independently of experience. This holds good for geometric science, as well as empirical science. Science deals with our *gists* of things.

# How do I do science?

Use your observation to classify the object. Hang on to the qualities that you see in all other members of the same class. Call these universal. Make subclasses for the ones that aren't universally shared, but partially shared. Vividly imagine the object, and propose something about it. Use the *gist* that you got from your senses to prove your proposition either true or false. If you didn't learn anything, maybe you didn't propose anything *falsifiable*.
