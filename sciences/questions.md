# Is it possible to think without questions?

Think about what? (No. All answers will be written parenthetically, since they are the scintillating motes that swirl in tizzies, undulating under questions, ceaselessly rowing, or, as carcasses: afloat and borne by bubbling, frothing waves to stretch like landscapes under cotton-candy sky to chew and salivate at birth of )the paradise(, what could at edges of snowglobe develop dew, if not for "fireflies! -- i am so compelled -- fireflies must they be." and wonder reigns...!~)

# What style of writing produces a line of thinking like a question's

That which is brisk and dissatisfied even with its cleverness. The tempo of the traveler who knows his train, stationed *right* there, has not shut off its actual engine: watch on the wrist of its conductor. This might be an ingredient of that concoction brewed by Archimedes, strange metabolism of the dirt. Holiness casual enough to exact the vengeance of a centurion. 

# Is it possible to write all of the Elements in the style of questions?

I see a way to do the first proposition. It's possible that a proof of any of the Elements's propositions requires only the imagination, and recognition of image-properties. Could *a priori* synthetic knowledge be possible otherwise? Images so clear and excitable that they are wont to be termed intuitions by some... 

# Proposition 1

Questions produce images. Product of a question-suite an image. 

# Proof

Can you imagine blank space? Can you see the whiteness of that space? Can you see the blackness of that space? What are you left with? Is it not the same blank space that, differing, stayed itself? 

# Corollary 1
To interrupt a chain of questions by an answer will prevent the construction of that image which the enunciation, in the form of a question of awareness, requires.

# Proof
Would you not have come up with a different image if you answered in between?

# Corollary 2
All enunciations can be related by questions of awareness, on the condition that they are presented after the construction. 

# Proof 
Is this not what we did above, in the penultimate question? A positive enunciation of the above proof could very well have been that blank space is itself, no matter what color is used to generate it. There would then be a very good question, however, whether color is required in its generation, and whether white or black are colors. So we see that via questions there is greater clarity of image, greater potency for clear and distinct concepts to arise from it. and the quality which served as proof for the proposition 

# Corollary 3

Pure reason has no problem accepting as totally vivid and compelling, the awareness of the necessary qualities of images regulated by the most bizarre juxtapositions.  impossible contradictory (minotaur, "unintuitive" 

# Proof

1. Minotaur has four legs. 
2. Minotaur has two legs. 
3. Centaur has fewer legs than minotaur. 
4. Centaur has more legs than minotaur. 

Here we see the importance of admitting the principle of non-contradiction as the first rule of a science which regulates speech. Corollary 1, we have that answers are the only thing which can limit the imagination. Science as body of images, or body of utterances?(!) Compare this to the conception of science as body of utterances(!) 

# Proposition 3

All constructions can be excited by questions of possibility.
