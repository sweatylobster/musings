Is it true that Galileo does not rely on effects demonstrated by Eudoxus, or Ptolemy? In what sense is that right? Either way -- he makes explicit use of Apollonius. Does Archimedes follow along with Euclid? What is a machine? Most of the time, we think about function, and not the direction of the underrsatnding which inevitably results from giving man a new medium and tool for thinking as a feedback of sensations -- typing as the force which makes thoughts govern themselves; what is the mode of punctuation? is it musical? how could it fail to be musical? really -- how could anything fail to be musical?
