# Abstract: What enables empirical inference? Descartes, Hobbes, MGS
Today, it is taken for granted that man has power over nature. The basis of this excellence is not corporeal, but noetical. As Descartes establishes that scientific inference will not lead to error, if the PNC is used, if we are always in conformity with self-evident propositions. For Descartes, iirc, for an idea to be considered true it must be imaginable with both clarity and distinctness. (C+D phantasm.) Formalization of the world: regulation of the world's form (Kant's *Verstand*) by, in my case as a learning engineer, formalizing causes as numerical identities(units). Reproduction of the arithmetic form of the world, solution of the arithmetic form of the world, and thus, by inference, intelligent (sapient) relation to nature. Venom Snake and Oedipus as homo sapiens (men made capable by Cartesian method, yet self-ignorant). Descartes sans Teiresias. This power is disembodied; the political implications of this are made vivid by Hideo Kojima. Disembodied reason requires the use of a machine (Metal Gear, "Cipher") in proportion with the will of this disembodied reason. Sahelanthropus is the "commonwealth" of Skull Face's pure reason. As concerns the activity of pure reason, it operates quite unremarkably -- or *regularly*. We must look, instead, to the concepts by which he predicts nature. In classical mechanics, this noetic apparatus is a theory of experience which enables practical logistics. Pure reason is always able to specify, *a priori*, the necessarily valid inferences from any axioms whatsoever, regarding concepts which are regulated by means of concepts (Lobachevsky, Poincare). This operation of pure reason is carried out always doggedly; i.e., independently of the special determinations (definitions, or axioms, or "customs") which regulate, by means of concepts, the special form of the valid inference. That the mind always follows the character of valid inference is compellingly argued by Peirce in "Some Consequences of Four Incapacities".
Empirical inference of quantified effect is enabled by the quantification of causes. We must avail ourselves of arithmetical (arithmetikos:[number-like]) noetic forms in experimental philosophy. Though certain tenets, or laws of physics are not necessarily articulated numerically (arithmos), they are the constant form of a proportion arithmetically attested to.  



# Karl Popper's definition of science
A science is a body of falsifiable propositions which never contradict each other. To the science of physics, culminating in the theory of special relativity, is added: "...each other, or any possible experience." See "Einstein interlude!"

# In general (but how general?)
All propositions of experimental philosophy are arithmetically verified: they depend on the quantization of causes and their necessarily ensuing, quantized effects. All use of proportion depends on arithmetical, or number-like, thinking -- not necessarily on numbers themselves! (1) Laws of physics are the constant and general form of the proportion between numbers, whose source in experience is qualitatively classified. The scope of a law is established by qualifying the objects which it regulates. The only meaning of modern science is that the mathematical, arithmetic objects its quantification of causes *underlying* world-objects result in empirically valid inferences. falsifiable propositions which have not yet been contradicted, and which do not contradict each other. 

1. Hence the current widespread use of complex and imaginary numbers in the disciplines of science. 

# What enables inference?
How does Kant account for the possibility of *a priori* science?  From A 115: "There are three subjective soures of knowledge upon which rests the possibility of experience in general and of knowledge of its objects--sense, imagination and apperception. Each of these can be viewed as empiircal, namely, in its application to given appearances. But all of them are likewise *a priori* elements or foundations, which make this empirical empoyment itself possible. *Sense* represents appearances empirically in *perception*, *imagination* in *association* (and reproduction), *apperception* in the *empirical conciousness* of the identity of the reproduced representations with the appearances whereby they were given, that is, in recognition." From this he (eventually) derives the conceptual unity of apperception, which, because of its deduced validity *a priori*, is necessarily valid for any possible experience of the world. In keeping with the determinations of Kant's work, Peirce proves that the mind always follows the character of producing a valid inference. 


# To prove

The validation of an empirical proposition is an analytic judgment. "Yes, I judge that this experience is X." Here, X is a concept-body, identical with a given synthesis of the manifold in intuition. All empirical propositions are analytic of any possible experience. though the judgment is a copula between the self and the manifold, synthesized in a concept.

# Einstein interlude!
This itself is an act regulated by Newton's fourth rule for reasoning in philosophy: "In experimental philosophy, propositions gathered from the phenomena by induction *are to be taken as true*, whether exatly or approximately, contrary hypotheses notwithstanding, until other phenomena appear through which they are either rendered more accurate or liable to exceptions. This must be done lest an argument from induction be nullified by hypotheses." 
"...rendered more accurate:" the correction of Maxwell's value for the velocity of light determined by the findings of Michelson and Morley. "...liable to exceptions:" the use of Lorentz transformations to maintain the inductive validity of the body of science, which utilizes the Galilei-Newton coordinate system for spacetime, since: the quanta resulting from measurement of a phenomenon visible to two coordinate systems, one "remote" and the other "local", at some light-distance, contradict. Since the Galilei-Newton coordinate-system holds good for "local" (I am ignorant of the light-distance necessarily implied by this use of local) empirical predictions, we *mustn't* throw it out.
