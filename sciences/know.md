# History, self-determination; identity and success

When the vein of a lucky break runs suddenly dry. The flaming sword, garden close -- closed (, rather). Adam didn't yet laugh at tubas as a child.
Anyway, I'm not sure what it means to be responsible for something. I'm bored by serial killers, though once they were interesting. The trick is limiting their political and technological effectiveness. Is it for the best that we do not have a manner of using algebra to determine the constituent parts for the imagination's end? Why is it that we would lack this science? How is it that this would possibly be obscure to us, when geometry and algebra are so clera? Why could it not be similarly clera that the end we want from ourselves as our energies directing us into the status of the future desired now is the energies in its negative, which is the present moment's desire. There must be in consciousness, after mathematical cognition has turned the understanding in on itself, the image-recognition, or eikasia, does not have a manner of accounting for the production of forces relevant to the completion of a goal, or a plot of a project. The geometrical, spatial reaction is given by the temporally exploded independence of parts which have a synthesis-plan. related to truth and the mastery of nature since I'm split between the theory of responsibility employed in social affairs, inadequate for articulating, in a fully causal scope, what's realized by an animal will. Might is right is . 

In what sense shall we find war to be in observance of a vital principle que la societe n'echappent point? 
reading Ortega y Gasset makes me have to reconsider how I make my approach. 

# Aristotle I guess?

To my current half-recollection, Aristotle defines the good in itself early on, only I can't remember what it is, or how it relates to virtue, at all. Because the Ethics covers friendship, the position of the virtuous man in society, the friendships availabe to the virtuous man, it seems that the good is necessarily social, and necessarily political. If the good of a man is not constrained by social, political relationships, it rather constrains them. This suspicion (please recall that I don't remember the book) is drawn from the fact that the virtuous man (megalopsychein?) has but one of the three forms of friendship available to him -- that of equality with another great-souled man. I speculate, therefore, still fancifully, that the polis itself, if seen only as a relation of its constituents, is a configuration of the good as it exists in the demos. It seems that there is only a certain amount of sufficient virtue required to sustain the polis.

Aristotle brings to mind the importance of making choices regarding our friends. What does it mean to have these, or those friends? Is there a type of settling that happens, which abases a man to the level of virtue of his company? In what sense is camaraderie possible?

What can I add to this? This for me is nothing short of a critical investigation of the Ethics, which is not the purpose or scope of the present essay. I would rather set up all of my suppositions and the identities which my own dad and his teachers gave me to navigate the world. So I begin criticism of my history instead, to attain a clear representation of myself as the sea into which history flows.

We might start best by asking in what sense an individual exists. We start with willing.

For law to rationally apply to actors, we invent a concept of social responsibility. The degree of murder does not give the degree of trauma, or brutality ascertained at the coroner's office. It is therefore in no way proportional to the individual's strength of will, but of their power (in no way moral!) to resolve upon an anti-social course of action. The degrees of murder indicate the coldness of their blood in acting. It does not show how great the need for punishment of the individual is, but rather, how easily entertained the possibility of their socially pertinent reform. Parole is awarded to convicts who *behave* well.

It is telling that school-shooter self-admission tapes show them soberly predicting the future. They are not anxious, their goals are well-stated, and they show no doubt or remorse.


# Motive, means, opportunity

Let's examine third-degree murder beyond morality. If we do so faithfully, we are at a loss when we ask "why?" "Why did he kill the cab driver?" Well, simply, life is exuberance and excess. Grinning, we might rather ask "why'd the coward stop there?" Morality easily provoked to give a satisfying "why" the motive, . concept of will constructed by that of social responsibility. All social actors so as to advance a social project, but the will might for a long time do nothing other than destroy possible political, social projects (perpetual rape and conquest). It's for the sake of social regulation that we limit meaningful actions to moral ones. In some sense, it's the opposite the really interesting one: we should wonder why he stopped there.


Here we say a rational person sees some benefit in the murder, since he is an actor deliberately choosing the murder to select the better of two futures. Because he acted, he must also have been able to stop himself. As intelligible as this conception of the will is, we quickly see how naive it is, when we find that the motive is very difficult to establish. Shouldn't the motive of a rationally acting individual come part and parcel with the will? 

The most egregious crimes are 


How does the concept of a will maintained by a nation-tongue's social-legal evidence of it, in accounting for the "why" of Genghis Khan? Could it be that Genghis Khan's why was but one thing? In what sense is a why possible, and not an immense *how*?

It for me to imagine a Procrustean bed when I survey the conquests of Genghis Khan, either Caesar, etc., as centralized in a *socially-relevant will.* , is to the actions attributed to a military leader. 

The terrific survey of acquisitions admired of this more recent conquerer shows us what little bearing the construct of "responsibility," so necessary to interpreting culpability and reformability in the legal realm, has in this brilliant celebration of one centralization, one will.


is and not a complex of beliefs and habits. It might be that fortune befalls not a person, but the complex of beliefs and habits which is the historical person. This is crucial for us to point out, since it immediately discards a number of accounts as to the seat of a person's success. For clarification, I need to expand on Gasset's **res gestae** -- transpired stuff. He claims that as nature is to things, history is to man. We should say that things persist in their nature, and that men persist in their history, even if any two particular, momentary configurations (of the thing or man) are different on comparison. In the strange biological-temporal complex which is man, that which persists as self-identity is his history. Therefore, through this chain of substitution that man has no nature but history. Here we have a very compelling account as to a reason that Darwin was so widely opposed! Sartre's Existentialism is a Humanism shows that the proposed humanistic principle of self-determination is not very alien to us at all. In fact, we might even feel that we waste time reading his essay, and in re-identifying the very cause of our human dignity from such a tortured man. At least Camus gives us a novel.



Necessarily, this is the same project as his perpetual self-determination, for the past is brought to bear on the now, for the future. To deny the past and the future their site in the present (if only potentially, or at times, housed here *very strange concept!*), we can turn to the proverb mentioned at the preface to the Gulag Archipelago: 

"Dwell on the past and you'll lose an eye. Forget the past and you'll lose both eyes."


In Sartre this historical self-determination seems almost to be a curse we which might be overjoyed to be worthy of, depending on our youth in confronting his philosophy. Existentialism is a Humanism inspired me in my teenage years, and seemed somewhat desolate at around 22, probably because I hacked into it with Nietzsche's supposedly Anti-Christian blade, concisely detailed in Twilight of the Idols. I saw the tiredness of Sartre, I don't know if appropriately, since it was such a fertile ground for my own vitality in youth, such a worthy rock to push up the hill...! I would gladly push for eternity.

And with so few sentences I unite, if only for myself, those philosophies of Nietzsche, Camus, and Sartre. This is the work of the poetic spirit in me, which comprehends all of philosophy. It might not be that poetry is a worthier tributary of our attention, since the most vital sources care only about pushing! Hence, to be more vital is to invite the war of poetry and philosophy. In the Gay Science, it's set forth: "War is the father of all good prose." And in prose, poetry is at war with casual parlance. When sculpting our own terrain as a country, we should be worthy of a Grand Canyon. We must flow our attention into all worthy and unworthy pursuits -- the greatest monuments were perhaps a waste with but little longevity -- but how marvelous Ozymandias is! Perhaps even greater so for his supposed immortality. 


to be most I might not even want to learn from those who were born fortunate. Perhaps we can only gain the secrets of good fortune from voyagers like Odysseus. However, those who stay near the top of a given discipline, even when they are "just lucky," are dominant by their recognition of fortunate opportunities. This psychological disposition does not fail to find situations for its application. Being zealous of opportunities is the first step to being generally successful.


To be more successful, it would be worthwhile to either practice the identification/implementation of the sufficient cause of success in diverse disciplines, so as to habilitate one to succeed. Causes are sometimes divided into two species: necessary and sufficient. Out of ignorance of another possible classification of causes, we'll work with this one.

From the observation that certain men succeed in diverse, and qualitatively varied arts, I infer that there are necessary cause(s) of success which are generally applicable. The alternative is to infer that such men, across the board, can determine the particular causes of success in the discipline of their choice. To say that they have this gift because they are born different is of no use to the investigation, since it accounts neither for the underdog, nor for the reality of one's personal improvement. 

Now, the phrase "general sufficient cause for success" is confused, and hardly has any meaning, other than the unique dizziness which it brings about. But, let's propose the corresponding question: Is there such a thing as a sufficient cause of success, in the general case? Grant me that the articulation of a sufficient cause might sound something like: "All it takes is..." It's obvious, then, that we have to answer our question negatively, because a sufficient cause is appropriate only for a given situation. 

# Why there cannot be a "generally applicable sufficient cause for success"

The obstacles to success are so diverse and particular to the discipline at hand, that a "sufficient cause of success" really means a narrow solution. Let's say my opponent's close to the edge of the ring, and I can win by a ring out -- then "all I have to do" is push him. This is not general, because it's only a win condition in this game. Add to this that this very win condition might be complicated for various reasons, such as a particular opponent's adeptness in reversing ring-outs. 

Now, the algebraic form of this particular problem is its own solution. We can also think of it as an integration problem, so that we can see all of the possible modes of success which require only *this* definite amount of force. This might be useful for determining which positions are optimal for smaller judo players. In the most definite way influencing practice, this would develop the forms and techniques which must be practiced against weight. 

The memory of a master finally lends itself the discrete reproduction by synthesis of discretely identified parts, by the structured imagination, which allows independent scenarios to be tested in their composite possibility. Sufficient causes of success are not what I am looking for here -- we want the necessary causes of success of an artful practice, which has to do with the psychology of the artist in practicing.




So now we get our objective: To detail the necessary causes of artful success. 



# Finding the necessary causes of success

We want to detail the general causes of skill and sophistication, which are necessarily everywhere applicable. I should only succeed if I attain principles so general that they are in application in *all* cases of success. Where should I look? In sports, since analysis of the mental states of players (their envisioned plan and physiology) is possible at every moment of practice. Because players are the actors, and therefore logical cause of any given game state, we can determine, by the tipping of a scale of the game state, whose psychology the game "prefers". Games are impartial judges, since their rules are consistent. By the balance of the game results, we'll determine who the better artist is. *Competence of the artist* must be judged by a different metric, since a Spartan can be eradicated by artillery. In this case, we have to say that Napoleon and the Spartan are playing different games, or perhaps a variation on the same game. Likewise, the Athenians and the US Navy, etc. It's necessary, then, to constrain our study to the cases where tools and success-implements are equally avaialable, excepting those in which the underdog succeeds! Here we'll see the excellence of strategy, and not of exuberant vitality (David & Goliath). On the other hand, we find the highest sophistication in sports by dominance, on the supposition that the players are equally matched in understanding of application of techniques particular to the art to the situations that the players recognize. Doing the right thing at the right time indicates, if it is not itself, high skill. One must see the consequences of actions with logical clarity, or one will be subjected to perpetual improvisation. Losing is not learning; losing is simply the consequence of implementing an (evidently) inappropriate plan. To learn The proper identification of scenarios in which the consequences of any action. 



Every sport, however, has particular configurations of dominance, which are the perfect execution of the conditions of success in the sport. To be dominated is the most demoralizing thing to suffer as a player -- but it is the most gratifying thing to manifest as a player. Dominance, then, is what the technique of all competitive sports aims to bring about. The conditions of success in any game must be viewed impersonally -- the brain has created a concept-body for the particular discipline at hand, which does not make him a supreme being in all respects. Skills do transfer over to other disciplines and arts. The competence of the other player disables the one from dominating the other. Video games are somewhat strange to as where an opponent can hardl which he only thing which we'll find competitive arts is that there are cases where a competitor has his back against the wall. 

# Why am I not as good as I used to be?

1. I love spontaneously furnishing beautiful constructions. Somehow this was transformed a few years ago into disavowing all understanding, so that I would be subjected to perpetual improvisation. I thought that I would be more worthy, more dignified, by my ability to blindly react and succeed in the moments of sudden resolution. I devalued dominance, since its conditions are logically necessary; by doing this I become anti-mathematical (dis-understanding), subjecting myself to perpetual confusion and haphazard improvisation, relying on the most general aspects of my constitution to bring me success. This is hardly a measure of my own worth as an animal (biological/neurological system) and as an artist, since my animal nature is to be an artist! Subjecting myself to perpetual improvisation and reaction is squandering the gift of anticipation, preparation, and imaginative intelligence. By forgoing the understanding of the conditions of dominance and success, I underestimate my opponents' ability to identify and reverse the conditions of my dominance. Therefore there is no competitive spirit, because I do not compete with a worthy opponent -- I only ever adapt a dead system to my play. So I have run into a paradox by not permitting myself to imagine the future: I don't respect myself for winning, since I win according to the logical necessity of the system (and I wonder why I have a hard time with mathematics and physics as of late), and I don't respect my opponent for fighting, since I feel that his fight is either futile against *me*, or that he is a bully abusing the logical conditions of success. In either case, I have become an anti-competitive being who likes winning? The contradiction startles me, although its ingredients elude me. How should I go about resolving this?



2. Because habits generally stay the same, either the habit's rusty/wrongly executed (physical) or wrongly applied to the situation (strategic). The deficiency of the first is, when not lack of practice, health (hydration, sleep, other factors). The deficiency of the latter is lack of foresight. In both cases, the envisioned situation is not the actual situation. The key to success is always preparation and adaptation to what is *really* happening. Reaction speed doesn't matter if there is no plan! One can have an arbitrarily fast reaction speed -- this will not defeat an opponent who has a very narrow win condition. The opponent has to err miserably 

# Strategy for improvement 

What is produced? What can we say gives a result? For logical clarity, conscious application of concepts to the task at hand. Strategy makes the largest difference between competitive individuals. I'm a body, my health as a body is the first place I should look. Am I as agile, capable, fearless as I used to be? The body harbors trauma, and always has to shed it by pushing it out. The first thing that one should do to improve, then, is correct old trauma. This means wagering on the success of old body parts; performing as well as one used to. "I still got it."
