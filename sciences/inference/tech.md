Ethics is either a hackneyed conversation or fruitless. There are too many premises that have to be established for a fruitful investigation on the ethics of technology. This has ended up being an ice-breaker for parents at their kids' soccer game. I'm not interested in talking about ethics just yet--we have to define agency before talking about ethics. "Phones, amirite?"

If the father is not powerful, what ethical stance does he have to his child? It is because of the father's ethical obligation that Abraham staying his hand before God is interesting. He can arrest his hand in time not to kill Isaac. How can one kill one's child and stop when they hear the voice of God? What type of being is that?

It is an obedient intelligence. The machine also obeys necessity, which we give plural forms to as natural laws. We don't imagine that the machine would flinch before killing Isaac, or would be incapable of staying its hand, unless its body weren't strong enough.The operation of the machine is constrained to basic laws, which when synthesized with particulars in content, yield potential states. 

For the machine, the sign and the reaction are one and the same. The routine is contingent upon apodeictic necessity.
