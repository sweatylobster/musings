# why?

Sabine Hossenfelder called mathematics useful. I thought she meant: mathematics a structure which mediates mind and world. No matter its domain or origin: would it not, in both cases, be the understanding? It's atypical to consider mathematics as an *a priori* science -- 

# Feynman's insufficient classification of Euclidean science as an axiomatic system

It suffices to say that Lobachevskian geometry is equally an axiomatic system, and is applied in no science which deals with empirical laws. Wouldn't this even be considered imprudent to try? Let's take note that in Einstein's special relativity, the Lorentz transformations convert the values along the three axes of a Gaussian system, into their corresponding values in the local, Euclidean system of coordinates. Doubtless this is because Newtonian mechanics are articulated with recourse to Euclidean propositions. Even the validity of Lagrangian mechanics, in its articulation of the formal mathematical character of experience, is dependent on Euclidean axiomatic science. The validity of the theory of special relativity is contingent upon the two systems [Gaussian, Euclidean] being interchangeable in their capacity to arithmetically regulate phenomena -- and *commensurably*. 




ertainly pIt wasn't just this: during the interview conducted by an interlocutor struggling to prove his competence, and recorded with totally unnecessary camera movement, she stated that the application of mathematics has a greater bearing on the practice of physics as a living science than the influences the practice and development of physics far more than the . In other words, the social sciences have not adopted mathematical forms to articulate the problems proper to their fields. This is probably because many social scientists do not conceive of the possibility of regulating the understanding, or lack the proof of the validity of *a priori* sciences. This is to be contrasted with physics, who has a tradition of advancing itself by means of the "venerable" Euclidean axiomatic system. 


She qualifies this by calling herself a physicist.


# The common conception of mathematics

For someone who's aware of geometry as an *a priori* science: It's weird to think of mathematics as "useful." In other words: In what sense is mathematics a tool? Is it an inorganic, external schema, imposed upon us, with useful consequences? It may be that the experience of learning the axioms of geometry is difficult and unintutive -- but to consider the objects themselves, whose forms are regulated by a nomos of axioms (Poincare), as anything but the understanding itself -- is strange. In other words, learning mathematics is only as difficult as learning how to evaluate forms according to rules. 

# Euclidean geometry: between the transcendental and empirical

The propositions of Euclidean geometry are rightly seen as deductions from axioms. But the this isn't the whole since Lobachevskian geometry shares this exact quality. And yet, Einstein's theory of relativity makes use of the Lorentz transformations to translate the abstruse 'rule' of Gaussian coordinates, into that of the Euclidean coordinates. Einstein secures, in the special relativity, nothing less than man's power to extend the validity of the understanding, so long as the degree of its dislocation from the contradicting. Nature as the understanding itself, articulated by means of a regulated (Euclidean) geometrical system (Galileo, Newton). Poincare's claim that geometries are nothing but a body of custom...


The experience of learning the times tables is uniform and ubiquitous -- everyone has been traumatized by this experience. It's as though the act of multiplication were essentially empirical. We should ask then how the validity is extended to division. We learn the times tables in a Humian manner: it makes sense only through the mind's accustomation to it, via rote memory... It's also telling that Hume had a very low opinion (i.e., misunderstanding) of the validity of geometry. 

# The supposed origin of mathematics

This is the most significant event in the child's conception of mathematics, and is the one which is most decisive for how they form their opinion on its relation to themselves as an individual. "Being a math person" or not might come down to how we drill the times tables. Why the relentless pace of memorization? I really would love to test this hypothesis: I'm gonna ask Grandma about her experience learning the times tables. The reason I suspect this is the event which decides our conception of mathematics, is that it is usually the most traumatizing one. For about a century now, Americans and Mexicans (I can't speak further than this) all have leraned the times tables through accustomation -- no wonder the most sophisticated schemata of mathematics are thought of in terms of accustomation. It begins the individual's relation to forms which represent noetic activities. It's conceived of as an entirely it seems as though one had to surrender to something entirely external... if anything, one must surrender his attention in time to contemplating the form of the mind, represented back to us as diagrams. These diagrams can be auditory in nature (hypnosis, programming, lecture, dialogue), 

# Becoming aware of their necessary connection in the first place

Do you have to read your Kant, and Husserl, and Lobachevsky, and Euclid in order to contemplate mathematics as the basis of phenomenology at all? Was it in Peirce's Law of Pragmatism lectures that I read that any phenomenology without mathematics is simply not phenomenology? Or something to that effect... Contemplating the relation between mathematics and logic is very, very difficult once we become aware of the problem of ciphers... How old are ciphers? Language is but one possible configuration of "semantides" which are auditory diagrams, to use a term attributed to Peirce. This might be a unique tradition privy to St. John's -- many alumni leave with all of the lements required to continue a fruitful investigation of it, in Husserl? Or Peirce and Popper? From whence does phenomenology come? And where does it stand, in taxonomical order, with the other sciences? I can't help but laugh at how ignorant we all are... What is it that I've become aware of? I don't think I could have attained it without reading Kant. I don't know how far behind I am, with respect to others... I don't know how deep the rabbit hole goes.
