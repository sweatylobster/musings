# why?
Sabine Hossenfelder called mathematics "useful".
But who could it be useful to?
And where did it come from?
People typically don't consider mathematics an *a priori* science.
To learn the meaning of the term apodeictic in college seems to be late.
So, mathematics is not itself a tool.
I think she means to say the body of symbols is a tool.
The reason for this, is that it is an external memory.
We'd have to start with Descartes's logistice speciosa (Jacob Klein's 'Greek Mathematical Thought and the Origin of Algebra' does most of the work which I see would be necessary: why is it that we can say we converted a magnitude into a letter? What does it mean to have a stand-in? Why do we begin with ratios before numbers? How fundamental is the notion of a 'stand-in' in the Greek view of mathematics? How are we to see our development of the Pythagorean notion of the cosmos as number, in present day? Are there fields which have not made progress simply because they have not yet received an arithmetic treatment, or are only certain senses, like vision and hearing (geometry and music) capable of receiving an arithmetic treatment? Can we have ratios for scent? And is harmony a ratio? We know harmonies hold in ratios -- but do we experience the ratio? No -- an octave up here is different from an octave down here. We *recognize* the ratio of octave that is held in common between the two particular octaves. We don't get a direct appraisal of *schemata* in the work, but, then again, we are dealing with arithmoi. What Pascal, however, says, about arithmetic falling out of geometry, might be relevant. p.434 : 

"Perhaps it will be thought strange that geometry cannot define any of the things that are its principal objects; for it can define neither motion nor numbers nor space, and yet thesse are the three things it particularly considerse and in acoordance with whose investigation it takes the three different names of mechanics, arithmetic, and geometry, this last word belonging both to the genus and to the species."

Why, then, would Dedekind seek an arithmetical definition of continuity if geometry is the genus and the species underlying arithmetic? Geometry always seems to require the use of an aid. One can use one's fingers to count -- but isn't this slow at a certain point? We actually can't employ our fingers in proving the general truth of an equation between a series of cubes and squares. For the terms he uses bridge gaps between the two. 

There's no common wellspring of its truth, because mathematics is not explored phenomenologically.

So there must be )

,The symbols and schemas we use to aid the understanding are tools.
And yet I have not been exposed to cogent theories on mathematical symbolism that are mainstream.
For me, such a theory would be able to honor Sir Rowan Hamilton's search for quaternions, as well as Maxwell's preference of them over 
The technique employed in Galileo's Third Day, Theorem 1, 



It wasn't just this: during the interview conducted by an interlocutor struggling to prove his competence, and recorded with totally unnecessary camera movement, she stated that the application of mathematics has a greater bearing on the practice of physics as a living science than the social sciences. In other words, the social sciences have not adopted mathematical forms to articulate the problems proper to their fields. This is probably because many social scientists do not conceive of the possibility of regulating the understanding, or lack the proof of the validity of *a priori* sciences. Our vanity on the one hand makes it difficult to simplify ourselves, and on the other hand simplifies nature with marvelous economy. 

But, now that I return to this essay after a few months, I see another cause.
It's not that we are vain; this is especially true of any particular man.
The difference is the nature of each science.
So social sciences, as Pagano 

Dougherty argues in ['Cartesian certainty, or awakening from the dreams of a slave'](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sjcdigitalarchives/original/8b651a21d35fe61381a296383111e927.pdf):

"Descartes aims in his philosophical work to discourage us from seeking the basis for our convictions concerning what is best for human beings. In 'The Meditations' as in 'The Discourses' Descartes provides a solid foundation for the sciences by limiting their scope, and knowledge of the good is and will forever be beyond the scientific pale. In place of a goal to strive for he offers a rule for determining that an assertion is true, and an aexample of strict self-restraint in refusing to assent to anything that may be illusory.'"


"Just as Descartes alters the ancient understanding of ta mathematica to include the elements out of which all figures are composed and only indirectly the figures (curves) themselves, so in general Descartes lowers our philosophical sights to focus on the bases of knowledge. In doing so he shows the way to develop an enormously successful investigation into the workings of nature. But instead of the hope for true if not always satisfying answers to fundamental moral and human questions, we get a rule for the management of our will. The best way to live can be known onlyl formally. What one 'decides' to be best may be best by convention, for our health and well-being or for the improvement of our souls. Hedonistic abandon would be irresponsible insofar as it clouds thought, but might one not decide that the best end to pursue would be tyrannical power? Descartes' moral thought requires that one give up the vain ambition to know what is truly and unequivocally good. But for all his promise to lay the foundation for a science that will disclose the secrets of the natural world, that science can provide little or no defense against evil ambition. Cartesian inquiry is detached from, even indifferent to the most pressing human questions..."

in particular, the reason for this lack of mathematical clarity in the social sciences, is due to the nature of the 'clear and distinct' criterion 

# Feynman's insufficient classification of Euclidean science as an axiomatic system

It suffices to say that Lobachevskian geometry is equally an axiomatic system, and is applied in no science which deals with empirical laws. Wouldn't this even be considered imprudent to try? Let's take note that in Einstein's special relativity, the Lorentz transformations convert the values along the three axes of a Gaussian system, into their corresponding values in the local, Euclidean system of coordinates. Doubtless this is because Newtonian mechanics are articulated with recourse to Euclidean propositions. Even the validity of Lagrangian mechanics, in its articulation of the formal mathematical character of experience, is dependent on Euclidean axiomatic science. The validity of the theory of special relativity is contingent upon the two systems [Gaussian, Euclidean] being interchangeable in their capacity to arithmetically regulate phenomena -- and *commensurably*. 

# The common conception of mathematics

For someone who's aware of geometry as an *a priori* science: It's weird to think of mathematics as "useful." In other words: In what sense is mathematics a tool? Is it an inorganic, external schema, imposed upon us, with useful consequences? It may be that the experience of learning the axioms of geometry is difficult and unintutive -- but to consider the objects themselves, whose forms are regulated by a nomos of axioms (Poincare), as anything but the understanding itself -- is strange. In other words, learning mathematics is only as difficult as learning how to evaluate forms according to rules. 

# Euclidean geometry: between the transcendental and empirical

The propositions of Euclidean geometry are rightly seen as deductions from axioms. But the this isn't the whole since Lobachevskian geometry shares this exact quality. And yet, Einstein's theory of relativity makes use of the Lorentz transformations to translate the abstruse 'rule' of Gaussian coordinates, into that of the Euclidean coordinates. Einstein secures, in the special relativity, nothing less than man's power to extend the validity of the understanding, so long as the degree of its dislocation from the contradicting. Nature as the understanding itself, articulated by means of a regulated (Euclidean) geometrical system (Galileo, Newton). Poincare's claim that geometries are nothing but a body of custom...


The experience of learning the times tables is uniform and ubiquitous -- everyone has been traumatized by this experience. It's as though the act of multiplication were essentially empirical. We should ask then how the validity is extended to division. We learn the times tables in a Humian manner: it makes sense only through the mind's accustomation to it, via rote memory... It's also telling that Hume had a very low opinion (i.e., misunderstanding) of the validity of geometry. 

# The supposed origin of mathematics

This is the most significant event in the child's conception of mathematics, and is the one which is most decisive for how they form their opinion on its relation to themselves as an individual. "Being a math person" or not might come down to how we drill the times tables. Why the relentless pace of memorization? I really would love to test this hypothesis: I'm gonna ask Grandma about her experience learning the times tables. The reason I suspect this is the event which decides our conception of mathematics, is that it is usually the most traumatizing one. For about a century now, Americans and Mexicans (I can't speak further than this) all have leraned the times tables through accustomation -- no wonder the most sophisticated schemata of mathematics are thought of in terms of accustomation. It begins the individual's relation to forms which represent noetic activities. It's conceived of as an entirely it seems as though one had to surrender to something entirely external... if anything, one must surrender his attention in time to contemplating the form of the mind, represented back to us as diagrams. These diagrams can be auditory in nature (hypnosis, programming, lecture, dialogue), 

# Becoming aware of their necessary connection in the first place

Do you have to read your Kant, and Husserl, and Lobachevsky, and Euclid in order to contemplate mathematics as the basis of phenomenology at all? Was it in Peirce's Law of Pragmatism lectures that I read that any phenomenology without mathematics is simply not phenomenology? (Yeah, lecture 2) Contemplating the relation between mathematics in its historical progression from the Greeks, and logic since the same, is very, very difficult once we become aware of the problem of ciphers for *geometry*... The Apostle translation of Aristotle uses ciphers to mark logical propositions, and then determine their relations by general terms. This is the end of application for ciphers:  Descartes's method of applying ciHow old are ciphers? Language is but one possible configuration of "semantides" which are auditory diagrams, to use a term attributed to Peirce. This might be a unique tradition privy to St. John's -- many alumni leave with all of the lements required to continue a fruitful investigation of it, in Husserl? Or Peirce and Popper? From whence does phenomenology come? And where does it stand, in taxonomical order, with the other sciences? I can't help but laugh at how ignorant we all are... What is it that I've become aware of? I don't think I could have attained it without reading Kant. I don't know how far behind I am, with respect to others... I don't know how deep the rabbit hole goes.
