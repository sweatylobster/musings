Masterclass of misleading.
Irony with constant reference to Socrates -- probably a beautiful read.
Subtlety. de Silentio as clerk, image of Phaedrus and Socrates under the Platonos tree, etc.
Stage direction.
Kant certainly has an Aristotelian nature, in the Heine quote.
C.f. Jung's *Psychological Types*.
For how subtle he is, I start with a surprise, that Kant, ignores the political technique Plato plassos possesses.
Is it surprising that Kant praises Aristotle and detracts from dialectic?
He has to set the definition of transcendental dialectic as the antidote to the misleadings of Platonic dialectic.
But this is the lesson of Plato, if only a subtle enough reader could see the design in the writings.
These have been preserved because their ostensible meaning is politically expedient.
To study the history of the discovery of more Platonic works.
We will never receive the Aristotelian works -- it's too late to unleash now.
Perhaps we already have, though under different names.
What is valuable is destroyed when one wants no one else to possess it.
Access is destroyed; access to power is destroyed when a library is.
The texts must be so expedient to this end, that practically *any* reader could gain immense power from a perusal of the science set forth in the texts, if they are to be destroyed.
But as surely as they are destroyed, they are preserved.
One does not kill a beautiful woman to deprive other men of her -- unless he has forever lost the possession of her. 
Helen of Troy can still be won back.
Or is that the point of the expedition?
Could it really be to destroy her?
To punish her?
In any case, Kant might misunderstand Plato's political philosophy.
How did I become initiated into the Straussian cult?
Billy Trabaudo, of course.
He was a good friend.
And how nefarious was he really?
I was very in control -- but this was beyond the question.
Everything worked out well; I know by the smile of Pagano and Dougherty, fresh in my mind from graduation day, that I did the noble thing.
I felt approved of, in sum.
Ms. van Boxel, too.
The kind of love they're capable of.
In any case, it's naivety to think of Plato as naive.
It's subtlety to think of Plato as subtle.
Plato is the mirror, not necessarily "the master."
Nevertheless, I do find Kant's remarks on the application of dialectic to be hygienic.
With all of the other continuities between Kant and Hegel I just noticed after looking at the Transcendental Logic, the tables of judgments and categories, and the first part on schematism -- I wonder whether the guy missed the boat on dialectic.
Or what is the Hegelian dialectic?
It's clearly an expansion of the Kantian tables.
I don't think detractions of Hegel are intelligent.
I refer especially to Karl Popper's, when he displays his own Aristotelian nature.
"Kant good. Hegel bad. Yay science." Ugh. 
Or does it amount to anything *critical?*
I can't recall a single phrase that troubles me with my lack of memory of it.
There was no articulation of facts regarding Hegel which I recognized as remarkable.
I don't think I'll overcome this error in my lifetime.
Plato as the master of deception.
Manager of ideas, which are the means of misleading.
A proof of the theory of forms?
The obsession with nominalism as a battleground or non-battleground.
Names as terrain for conflicts that can be staged.
Plato's doctrine.
Certainly not the Timaeus, for problems I've stated elsewhere.
viz. The contradiction of dialectic.
Maybe not everyone had access to his works as we do now?
I forget the history of the discovery of his works.
There's also translation to consider.
Or who actually read him.
Biggest obstacle, really.
