This isn't an essay, these are notes.
Be pleasant.

I was reading actualization of self-consciousness in the Phenomenology of Spirit,
and saw I made a note on this distinction Hegel makes between individuality and reality.
Individuality comes to recognize itself via its movement in actuality. 
In fact, this is what conditions the joy in oneself that consciousness comes to,
only if it recognizes this its predicament. 

The law of the heart never suspends the laws of actuality.
This is not its meaning, and we ignore the law of our hearts by mistaking it for such a suspension, or mutiny. 
My necessary actuality conditions my individuality.
In fact, my individuality is actuality individuating itself. 
So there is no interruption of the universal principles which I *myself* have surmised **do** cohere in the world,
nor is there an emergent contradiction on comparing this set of principles with those gleaned solely *a posteriori*. 
No principle gleaned either *a priori* or *a posteriori* is broad enough to eclipse any other.
The only thing negated by establishing principles is the conditions of erroneous inference.

Hegel speaks of madness, so I came to the problem
I experience as a psychedelic dude: how do I deal with my madness?
The madness is that no one has this in common with me.
What's worse: no one can possibly imagine what I did experience, and register as sacred.
So I have a secret. And I thought I was a candid person, destined for earnesty and relatability. 
It turns out that my life is meant to be more interesting, after all. It's funnier this way, anyway.
My madness is that I can't use language to give someone any succession of phantasms that affects their passions as mine were affected. 
The nature of phantasms, of language -- itself changes on psychedelics!
The suitability of language to latch onto phantasms, or to track important, significant, palpable changes in their meaning and configuration,
is intensely questioned and ridiculed! No proper or convincing response is mounted by any organ with which a person can identify.
This leaves dreamers scrambling for sure ground. "...et non en avant." For this reason!
And I find the persistence of the sense of veracity, importance, crucial-ness -- itself very important!
So at the same time that there is *something* immediate, which is very important to communicate,
it is impossible to convey to anyone not experiencing this modulation of individuality,
given by physiological modulation. Obviously the modulation happens by pharmacological mechanisms.

The clarity is in the immediacy of objects. "This is the way things are showing up for me."
People don't socialize with anybody who is mad, except for mad people.
And mad people are mad.
But there are fun mad people, and brilliant mad people, too, so it can be really good.
Socializing with other mad people nostalgically just makes magic. 

Back to Hegel's law of the heart and psychedelics:
Exactly what is not regulated by the law of the heart 
is seen as immediately unessential.
At least, this was my initial reading which I doubted after writing it,
though less viscerally and importantly than in the past. 
But, consciousness knowing it coheres in this its alien complement,
recognizes itself as the actual existence  which specializes itself in moments (here *too*),

               ( genus : species :: actuality : individuality )

making it essentially the movement through its alien self, which is actuality.
Therefore the law of the heart is honored in the world's apparent hostility to it.
It is the world's aspect with special regard to this law of the heart. 

But more on reason's judgment of the laws once I'm done with this section!
