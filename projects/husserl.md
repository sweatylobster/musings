# Introduction
I have been influenced heavily by Husserl's Crisis of the European Sciences.
Would that my writing does not cast a shadow on his.
My questions inhere in the transcendental subjectivist philosophy which Descartes began.
Particularly, I'm concerned with page 82, section 19:

## Quote first: apodicticity's advent

"What the modern period calls the theory of the understanding or of reason --in the pregnant sense "critique of reason," transcendental problematics--has the roots of its meaning in the Cartesian *Meditations*. The ancient world was not acquainted with this sort of thing, since the Cartesian epoche and its ego were unknown. Thus, in truth, there begins with Descartes a completely new manner of philosophizing which seeks its ultimate foundations in the subjective. That Descartes, however, persists in pure objectivism in spite of its subjective grounding was possibly only through the fact that the *mens*, which at first stood by itself in the epoche and functioned as the absolute ground of knowledge, grounding the objective sciences (or, universally speaking, philosophy), appeared at the same time to *be* grounded along with eerything else as a legitimate subject matter *within* the sciences, i.e., in psychology. Descartes does not make clear to himself that the ego, his ego deprived of its worldly character [*entweltlicht*] through the epoche, in whose functioning *cogitationes* the world has all the ontic meaning it can ever have for him, *cannot possibly* turn up as subject matter *in* the world, since everything that is of the *world* derives its meaning precisely *from these functions*--including, then one's own psychic being, the ego in the usual sense."

This is nothing short of the advent of apodicticity.

Quote continued:
"Even more inaccessible to him, and naturally so, was the consideration that the ego as it is disclosed in the epoche, existing for itself, is as yet not at all "an" ego which can have other or many fellow egos outside itself. It remained hidden from Descartes that all such distinctions as 'I' and 'you', 'inside' and 'outside,' first 'constitute' themselves in the absolute ego."

For proof of Descartes's misapprehension of the universality of what he grasped in himself, it suffices to recall his conversation about 'humanoids.' We should ask whether the faulty proof of God would be necessary if Descartes had conceived of a kind of methexis in the absolute ego as Husserl suggests here with 'constitute'.

"Thus it is understandable why Descartes, in his haste to ground objectivism and the exact sciences as affording metaphysical, absolute knowledge, does not set himself the task of systematically investigating the pure ego--consistently remaining within the epoche--with regard to what acts, what capacities, belong to it and what it brings about, as intentional accomplishment, through these acts and capacities."

Exegesis

"Since he does not stop here, the immense set of problems cannot reveal itself to him, i.e., those of beginning with the world as a "phenomenon" in the ego and systematically inquiring back, to find out which of the actually demonstrable immanent accomplishments of the ego have given the world itse ontic meaning. An analysis of the ego as *mens* was obviously for *him* a matter for a future objective psychology."
