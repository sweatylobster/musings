# Introduction

This folder houses my two projects for the year.

1. scent-epistemology
2. pragmatics

Both projects are *modern* projects.
That is, they engage with Cartesian dualism (defined in descartes.md).
I argue against the scope of dualism on phenomenological grounds.
Serious criticism of Descartes requires a phenomenology of dreaming.
For this I draw from Husserl and Bachelard, with reference to Valery and Baudelaire.
The "transcendental motif" Husserl explores from Descartes to Kant is born of oneiric soil.
In descartes.md I argue that 
This is the fertile ground on which Descartes was able to found a mathesis universalis.
The ground for the objective sciences would be just as sure had he made the *logistice speciosa* or not.
The Freudian ego is a corollary to Descartes's original accomplishment.
Freud was simply one of the first to pursue a science of the dreaming ego.
Bachelard seems to deny that the dream gives symbols as banal as can be interpreted as purely social ones (pp. 148, 150)
From here we pause aporetically, dramatically, and say:
Is Baudelaire's 'Parfum Exotique' a rêverie?
It seems like a rêverie par excellence by Bachelard's definition on pp. 150:
Though he started on his lover's breast, he's aware of himself.
The guy's probably hard for Christ's sake. How's that for flesh and blood.
Speaking of which, we'd be hard pressed to find a more exemplary rêverie.
152, drug users. Baudelaire was a goddamned dandy druggie, so yes, he regulated his 'psychic chaos' with rêveries and drugs.

## Meaning of the projects

The scent project argues that the sense of smell, however,
is unfairly smuggled into this judgment.
That is, if I look at my experience of smelling,
I realize that I cannot doubt the reality of smelled things,
even though I cannot reproduce scents as I can other aesthetic impressions.
Valery's Eupalinos versus les parfums Baudelairiens (valery.md).

So we clarify the senses Descartes refers to: vision, sound, and touch -- all of which are mediated by ganglia in the *peripheral* nervous system.
The phantasiai of smelling are qualitatively different from other phantasiai.
If I look at the experience of smelling, as well as how Baudelaire's poetry, for example, evokes the impressions which certain scented compounds do evoke, I realize that it is an entirely different aesthetic phenomenon.
There is no right to doubt the reality of the sense-impressions yielded by scent.
We need to first trace Descartes's method of arguing from the case of dreams, and then view our evidence that smell functions differently from other senses *in the context of dreams*.

### Evidence

When a smell enters our dreams, it is *really* in the world.
We cannot but have a percept of a scent unless it is in the world.
The proof is that we cannot conjure up scent-impressions.

We can conjure up any visual or acoustic impression (artists, composers), but the perfumer or cook must work by tasting.
Here's the main proof, which has to do with the way these different artists *realize* their work:
The disappointment of the artist is that he was not skilled enough to do justice to his vivid sense-impression.
"If only my hand were more skilled."
The disappointment of the cook, however, is that he didn't get the right ingredients.
"I thought lemon would go really well; maybe these lemons are bad."
Or in the case that he cooks something according to plan, he's still pleasantly surprised with how it turns out.
He might know that garlic, rosemary, and butter will go well with the chicken, but he operates not dissimilarly to an alchemist, or chemist.
The perfumer is essentially a chemist.
Let's also continue the analogy, to perfect the distinction between the senses.
A musician or composer can hear a chord and analyze its notes and ratios, just like an artist can measure the ratio of one line to another.
Where the visual artist has geometry, the acoustic artist has music theory, both of which are sciences of *ratio*.
Therefore the acoustic and visual senses are both capable of arithmetic representation by [the Pythagorean concept of number.](Jacob Klein, Greek Mathematical Thought and the Origin of Algebra)
Even a

Really, doubt of the senses would refer only to the senses we can conjure up in dreams.

## Descartes as the father

1. Logistice speciosa
2. Res extensa
3. Ego cogito -> (Freud et al)

Descartes is the man we need to read to understand our heredity.
Dualism is a radical simplification; the body can be doubted, the mind cannot.
The consequence of dualism is an ontological certainty in self and number.
Husserl traces the transcendental motif of Descartes to Kant, which in a word, is apodicticity, or self-evidence.

## Complications with the modern

No symbolic calculus of the body, will, action, or pain
The height of feeling and suggestion of emotions is poetry
