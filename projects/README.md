# Introduction

This folder houses my two projects for the year.

1. scent-epistemology
2. pragmatics

Both projects are *modern* projects.
By this I mean they confront the problem of Cartesian dualism.
Effectively, dualism states that the body can be doubted and the mind cannot.
Because the senses belong to the body, they too are therefore doubted.
<!-- The origin of this idea is Descartes's interpretation of the dreaming ego. -->
<!-- We suffer sensations while asleep and awake; half of the time, therefore, these aren't real. -->
<!-- But we persist throughout both states. -->
<!-- Therefore, the body (and senses, Descartes smuggles in) can be doubted, and the mind cannot. -->
<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- We arrive at this conclusion by a peculiar path Descartes takes. -->
<!-- It's often overlooked that Descartes defines the body by what it is felt to be in dreams. -->
The scent project argues that the sense of smell, however, is unfairly smuggled into this judgment.
That is, if I look at my experience of smelling, I realize that I cannot doubt the reality of smelled things, even though I cannot reproduce scents as I can other aesthetic impressions.
So we clarify the senses Descartes refers to: vision, sound, and touch -- all of which are mediated by ganglia in the *peripheral* nervous system.
<!-- The phantasiai of smelling are qualitatively different from other phantasiai. -->
<!-- If I look at the experience of smelling, as well as how Baudelaire's poetry, for example, evokes the impressions which certain scented compounds do evoke, I realize that it is an entirely different aesthetic phenomenon. -->
There is no right to doubt the reality of the sense-impressions yielded by scent.
We need to first trace Descartes's method of arguing from the case of dreams, and then view our evidence that smell functions differently from other senses *in the context of dreams*.

#### Descartes's way
The origin of this idea is that Descartes wants to [place philosophy on sure grounds.](Crisis of the European Sciences, pp.75)
The truth of propositions admitted into philosophy must be 'clear and distinct.'
'The transcendental motif' [Husserl speaks of](Crisis of the European Sciences, pp. 60, 75) is, in a word, apodeicticity.
The method is to subject everything to doubt and see what can't be doubted.
For example, we doubt that the body exists, which appears ridiculous.
But when we wake up from our nightmare, we're grateful it 'wasn't real.'
We have sense impressions, referred to our body, when we're awake *and* asleep.
That means that, half of the time, our senses are detached from nature.
That is, they don't report the true state of affairs in the world.
So how can we trust something that's false half of the time?
The trouble with this 
So whatever conception we have of the body, at least half of the time, doesn't point to a true state of things.
Therefore, the senses, which come from the body, 
But why would this be necessary? What is dualism?
Descartes submits all cogitations to doubt.
When Descartes tries to doubt the existence of his mind, he fails.
In short, dualism is a falsification which has simplified the zetetic process.
In short, the lack of knowledge on scent for e
Descartes is the man we need to read to understand our heredity.

##### Evidence

When a smell enters our dreams, it is *really* in the world.
We cannot but have a percept of a scent unless it is in the world.
The proof is that we cannot conjure up scent-impressions.
We can conjure up any visual or acoustic impression (artists, composers), but the perfumer or cook must work by tasting.
Here's the main proof, which has to do with the way these different artists *realize* their work:
The disappointment of the artist is that he was not skilled enough to do justice to his vivid sense-impression.
"If only my hand were more skilled."
The disappointment of the cook, however, is that he didn't get the right ingredients.
"I thought lemon would go really well; maybe these lemons are bad."
Or in the case that he cooks something according to plan, he's still pleasantly surprised with how it turns out.
He might know that garlic, rosemary, and butter will go well with the chicken, but he operates not dissimilarly to an alchemist, or chemist.
The perfumer is essentially a chemist.
Let's also continue the analogy, to perfect the distinction between the senses.
A musician or composer can hear a chord and analyze its notes and ratios, just like an artist can measure the ratio of one line to another.
Where the visual artist has geometry, the acoustic artist has music theory, both of which are sciences of *ratio*.
Therefore the acoustic and visual senses are both capable of arithmetic representation by [the Pythagorean concept of number.](Jacob Klein, Greek Mathematical Thought and the Origin of Algebra)

Really, doubt of the senses would refer only to the senses we can conjure up in dreams.

## Descartes as the father

1. Logistice speciosa
2. Res extensa
3. Ego cogito -> (Freud et al)

Descartes is the man we need to read to understand our heredity.
Dualism is a radical simplification; the body can be doubted, the mind cannot.
The consequence of dualism is an ontological certainty in self and number.
Both are identity. The one is one, all others are many, like the set of rationals.
Husserl traces the transcendental motif of Descartes to Kant.
The motif, in a word, is apodeicticity, or self-evidence.

## Complications with the modern

No symbolic calculus of the body, will, action, or pain
The height of feeling and suggestion of emotions is poetry
