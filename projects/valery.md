Who feels that he has been capable of crafting scents like an architect?
If in cooking a meal, we feel like architects () [^1]

p.70 "Phaedrus: I was a close friend of him who built that temple.
He came from Megara and was called Eupalinos.
He gladly spoke to me of his art,
of all the care and the knowledge that it requires;
he made me understand everything that I saw with him in his workshop.
I observed, above all, his astounding mind.
I found in him the power of Orpheus.
He foretold their monumental future to the shapeless heaps of stones and beams that lay around us;
and those materials, at his voice,
seemed dedicated to the one and only fates propitious to the goddess would have assigned them.
How wonderful were his instructions to the workmen!
They retained no trace of his difficult meditations of the night before.
He gave them nothing but commands and figures.
Socrates: That is the very way of God.
Phaedrus: His instructions and their acts fitted together so happily that it seemed as though these men were nothing more nor less than his limbs.
You cannot believe, Socrates, what a joy it was for my soul to have knowledge of a thing so well regulated.
I no longer separate the idea of a temple from that of its edification.
When I see one, I see an admirable action, yet more glorious than a victory and more contrary to wretched nature.
Destroying and constructing are equal in importance, and we must have souls for the one and the other;
but constructing is the dearer to my mind.
O most happy Eupalinos!"
