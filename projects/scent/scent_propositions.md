# Propositions

1. Smell does not admit of perspectival error; one scent cannot be confused with another. It is in visual analogy, circumspect. [^1]
2. Just as one melody can't occult another, so can no scent occult another. In acoustic analogy, it deals with unities, or notes.[^2]
3. Therefore, as the art of harmonizing melodies across time is music, the art of harmonizing scents across time is perfumery.
4. Smells diminish in intensity and not character.
5. The olfactory sense gives an intuition for entropy.
6. What we smell is really here (at the nose). 
7. Everything smelled has a source in the world.
8. No one has ever been convinced that they smelled something in a dream that was not in the world when they woke up.
9. Each smell is a unit that does not admit of stoicheic/chemical analysis. [^3]
10. Perfumes are a unity that does admit of analysis, but the degree of exactitude depends on recognition of familiar underlying scents.

## Explanations

[^1]: Perspectival error has its only meaning as a visual concept. You can't tilt your head an odd way and confuse one scent with another. I dare you to see if laundry detergent doesn't suddenly smell like itself by leaning against a wall, or even closing your nostrils. But you can confuse a cone with a triangle at a distance, because they have the triangular shape in common. Or, you might think you see a triangle, but, after walking around it, realize it's *actually* a trapezoid. This is what I mean by perspectival error: the error is merely due to perspective, and is corrected with circumspection. We realize what these visual objects *actually* are. But do we ever realize what a smell *actually* is without spending more time thinking about it? We might be able to remember what it is called if we get closer to the source. We just need more of what it is to excite the moment of recognition, like a titer. But there's no tip-of-the-tongue sensation with the recognition of visual objects. Visual objects are straightforward and capable of analysis. Analysis is even boring, or mundane with the visual. It's downright impossible with the olfactory, but more on this later. At the same time, we do not always see the whole. Objects are occulted by other objects. This is why a panorama (everything available to sight) is so amazing, so lucid -- everything's in view at once. Nevermind that we can't pay attention to all parts of our ken -- we can only direct our attention to fields in our ken, and usually, we fixate on objects. It is possible to let the eyes glaze over, but this is not a typical waking, beta-wave brain state. It's meditative, ruminatory. And even then, it's not comprehensive. Objects are not distinguished. So it seems that optical fixation on an object is required for its recognition.

[^2]: Some teenagers smoke weed in their dad's car, then spray perfume in it. Now the car smells like weed and his cologne, because both weed smoke and cologne are in the car. The only way you get close to obfuscating the olfactory evidence of smoking weed in the car is by increasing the amplitude of another scent. But then again, just as the sound emanates from a source, so too does the scent. By moving through the car, or just by the random motion of the particles, dad might catch a whiff of smoked cannabis in the car on his way to work one morning. And that's all it takes to start investigating his teenage son, who will be sweating on the way home from school, and crying that night after being grounded for months. The writer does not speak from personal experience.

[^3]: We cannot smell hydrogen, carbon, or any other element in a molecule composed of it.
