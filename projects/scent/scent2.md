MGSV thoughts, Language and Scent

The MGSV thoughts are disorganized. We can start to evaluate the dates
displayed in Ground Zeroes using the gz.md file, and the themes of the
father and fatherland in mgsv.md. Beyond that, I need to make a general
plan for analysis of MGSV.
'Because I authored it, I authorize it'
'Under what authority? Who is the author?'

The Language and Scent essay is motivated by reading Umberto Eco,
but really uses Kant and Baudelaire to talk about the limitations of the
way AI can sign the world. In other words, how is AI capable of playing
the imitation game? 

And then, should we not define the human on the ability to reproduce,
'Under what authority? Who is the author?'
deceive, imitate, but by its ability to be deceived? Why else would we
be enraged by losing in games? Or punish counterfeiters? What is
authenticity to a machine? Authority seems to be a very human notion,
with a hardly geometrical definition. 

In some sense, yes -- AI performs well on certain tasks. 
DALL E shows an inventiveness, or at least, imitates those who we'd find
inventive. However, the creators of DALL E have clearly named it after
Dali. They recognize his creativeness, pay homage to it first. DALL E is
not thought to have an imagination.
And part of the imagination is the ideal realm, or the two are
identical.
Humans can entertain the notion of a world beyond our own -- 
The Word of Nietzsche: God is Dead is an essay that most of the world
has not 'felt'. While, even now, the madman is probably still early,
we should ask rather if his audience is too late. 

Cartesian dualism is infectious, or at the very least, tenable.
It's easy to entertain, and there is no shortage of philosophy majors
who believe that Plato spoke by means of Socrates. 
People would like to establish a principle or precedent which allows
them to separate the mind from the world. This doesn't have a
straightforward solution. To really say how the 'solutions' differ, I'd
have to do a bit better than Hegel's wide sweep of Eastern philosophy
under the rug.
Still, when Hegel defines the western of notion of Freedom, as Reason's
awareness that it is all reality, he distinguishes this spiritual self-realization
from the asceticism of Indian and Chinese spirituality.
According to Hegel, the spiritualism of Eastern cultures takes ascetic form.
I think it's a good idea to bring up Husserl's Vienna lecture, where he
also distinguishes philosophy as a Greek and therefore European
inheritance from other 'philosophies.' Philosophy is not philosophies.
Furthermore, philosophy is not an arbitrary European construct, though
it is our inheritance. It is a true human spiritual accomplishment.
And this is why the European sciences are in a crisis?
Perhaps because science is seen as a take-it-or-leave-it activity,
and not the realization of the infinite human tasks, realized as
spiritual activity. Thus Descartes is not merely an ascetic on equal
footing with Buddha, whatever the similarities of their categorical
divisions might amount to. 
Descartes could beget a science. (Lachterman: Descartes's revolutionary
paternity)
Padui criticizes and traces this notion to Kant.
Constructs, in Kant, do not have a clear meaning, because of their
analogy with the step in a

in my tracks and perfectly articulated my reservations about his
definitions, even though the assertion that je pense, donc je suis,
is perfectly acceptable, and necessary. It just seems *so* self-evident,
that the context of the problem doesn't beget it. It seems that it could
be the solution to so many different problems. But then, we're talking
about a particular type of truth, which does not solve the doubt in the
world. This is something rather that Baudelaire finally accomplishes, by
drawing the difference between the lack of clarity in dreams ( the
monster smoking his hookah in the beginning, swallowing the world with a
bored yawn, crying an involuntary tear from his eye, irritated by the
smoke, -- us -- the monster of ennui. Je suis ca, donc tu l'est.)

Really, I think this has huge implications for my thought on AI.
I'm interested in the Kantian conception of the imagination which
schematizes the sense impressions into concepts. (SIA p.141)
The reason I'm interested in this paper at the moment, considering my
exploration of the philosophy of AI, is the unexplored nature of the
imagination. From the 

Where Euclidean geometry seems to reproduce the character of the
understanding, where its elements and latent convictions lie open
to us visually, there doesn't seem to be an art which reflects back to
us the nature of smelling. 
We can use language to envision, by use of unequivocal terms.
E.g.: coordinate axes, points, lines, vectors, quaternions, etc.
Sure -- they all need to be defined, but we all seem to be on board.
Furthermore, we're more inclined to use Euclidean geometry. 
Also -- why is the 5th postulate available, ready to be accepted or not
by the choice of the geometer? Lobachevsky was the first to explore the
consequences of not accepting it. 

There 

However, language might not be capable
The thesis is that scents occupy a different existence in language than
sights and sounds.
This makes the notion of 'signing' scents complicated.
In other words, what are the semiotics of scent?
I see Baudeliare exploring this in CORRESPONDANCES. 
He uses analogy, which as always, seems to cross all boundaries.
(Homer, poets, Plato's use of eidos which strains the language,
according to Heidegger (which essay?????) )

AI is aware of periodic data, as in those data
given to it by a waveform. (Audio, video).
It cannot be in the world because it does not have
scent. 
Furthermore, AIs lack the capacity for recognition as we have it,
because our capacity for recognition is displayed fully in the sense of
scent, precisely where it is not available to language to have full conceptions of

How do Fourier transforms relate to ML algorithms?
Are there problems which are solved by means of Fourier analysis?
Feature-recognition/ patterns uncovered by means of FFT, etc?
What does convolution mean?

Then I also wanted to investigate how it is that we represent
scent in language. Of course, Baudelaire was appropriate for this
reason.

So, I was focused on Eco for AI reasons.
How does an AI understand the world?
It is given to it in signs.
Turing's "imitation game" is played semiotically, not 'symbolically'.
A symbol can mean more than the sign implementing it to proportion
something to the reader. 'Proporcionar una noticia'
The man's body cannot appear, the woman's voice cannot be discerned.
There is no body, no source, and in short -- no symbol.

"What Tarquinius Superbus said in the garden by means of the poppies,
the son understood, but the messenger did not."
However, this latter quote has to do with analogy.
"As the poppies, so the usurpers."

Scent is a strange sense. 
It is not mediated by a ganglion in the PNS.
It is, unlike sight and sound, sensitive to particles, and not waves.
Friction of the particles induce a scent at the nasal bulb.
Furthermore, dreams are devoid of scent-impressions.
Scents are therefore directly connected to the waking environment.
For Descartes, there is res extensa, and res cogitans.
The wax problem illustrates the nature of the two.
Quelque qualites de la cire sont res cogitans. 
Depuis de derober la cire de ses qualites,
couleur, chaleur, forme, etc.
ce qu'existe encore et res extensa.
But Baudelaire implicitly points to the fact that language cannot
indicate all res cogitans.
For example, the list of scents at the end of IV. CORRESPONDANCES
le musc, le benjoin, l'encens, Cartesian dualism doubts the senses, and does not doubt the mind.
The mind does not persist in dreams, though the 'I' does.
Otherwise 'I' would not realize I was being deceived with the dream.
Therefore, Baudelaire undoes Cartesian dualism
which rests on an interpretation of dreams problem.
by pointing to the transport of the senses via scent.
How can we indicate the sensations that are peculiar to scent?
Baudelaire includes the names of perfumes and scents in his poetry.
