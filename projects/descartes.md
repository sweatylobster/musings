# I admire Descartes for the same reasons I object to him

My prejudice when first reading Descartes: he does not understand dreaming.
"It's just a stepping stone for his argument."
Now I see his mistrust of the senses as *fortunately* hasty.
Descartes opened up the world of the dreamer who walks by means of symbols.
Descartes is like a blind mountain hermit bounding from crag to crag without vertigo.
We grounded mortals complain about his foot placement while he shows us the dreamer's way of walking.
He's still blind, though. Algebra and *logistice speciosa* as braille.
If Descartes were careful, we wouldn't have anything miraculous.
He doesn't think about anything before he does it -- he just shows you how he walks, purely.
I mean, the guy is practically stammering when responding to his penpal Catherine.
That and the complete exposure of his Method.
So Descartes is the model for earnestness.

The Cartesian epoche has an oneiric origin.
For example, Freud's dream analysis method is a corollary to Descartes' discovery of the 'ego'.
That is, the 'ego' persists in dreams.
It is *I* who wakes up from the dream; I'm in the dream world at one time, and *then* the real world, in succession.
Then in the Kantian mode of speaking, the *a priori* intuition of time respects the periodicity of dreaming.
The transcendental unity of apperception is transcendental precisely because it is not annihilated by dreaming.
It is possibly strengthened. Each night of dreaming might be something of a war of identity.
"War is both father and king of all. It *revealed* the divine and the human, and made some free and others slaves."
The more one practices dreaming, the more one is perfected by it. Dreaming as our ego's perfection.
Can we identify Kant's 'transcendental unity of apperception' with Freud's 'ego'? Compare the two.
Experience gives the world to the ego, but the ego.

## Themes

1. Various organs interact with truth differently (eyes-truth, nose-epistemology -- Cartesian )
2. 

## Projects
2. The nose will redeem epistemology by dreaming *awake* (Husserl, Baudelaire, Nietzsche)
6. Man the dreamer: Transcendental theme of the Cartesian epoche is arrived at by an interpretation of the dreaming man who awakens. Bad judgment about the senses--scent is clearly neglected. Impossibility of an epistemology which neglects the function of the nose in producing percepts for the dreaming ego. Time to wake up. "We are unknown to ourselves, we men of knowledge."
of nature spurs the mental instincts by repression to exert power

# Introduction

We can imagine spaces we've never seen before, and feel a distinct aesthetic impression.
I can feel cramped from a drawing, an architecture plan, or just my imagination.
But we can't imagine smells we've never experienced.
How *does* literature access the olfactory organ?
Even remembering what perfume smells like is difficult, distinct as it is.
Maybe all we have is the impression it makes.
Still, why is the imagination limited to visual productions?
Why don't we also have the ability to conceive of smells analytically, or harmonically?
This relates to choosing the right ingredient while cooking.
Sometimes we associate lime with certain foods, or think of *acidity* as complementary.
So we're using a chemical framework.
But other times rosemary pops into mind when I ask: "what would go well with this?"
I know what rosemary is.
I know what I'm referring to, and know that it's complementary.
When I open the jar and remember it, I prove to myself that I know what it is.
But I don't smell it until I open the jar.
But to think of rosemary categorically wouldn't help a cook anyway -- entropy.
Entropy with light? I don't think so. How? Maybe information loss, like Shannon.
But definitely entropy with smell. Diffusion, etc.
This is important because only sight can do philosophy.
So this has to do with which senses are apodeictic.
I can't give myself evidence of what the smell is.
I can give myself of 11 being a prime number.
But the main point is you can't re-make/reproduce the scent itself.
Furthermore you can't smell anything in your dreams not from the world.
Descartes never realized this when he doubted all of the senses.

## Questions

How *does* literature access the olfactory organ?
It's clear I can't reproduce smells.
Not *vividly*, anyway.
Chanel number 5 is pretty easy to conceive of though.
All of the sense impressions come rushing together.
But there are girlfriends who gave me clothes of theirs, and I can't smell those things.
I think I remember Ari's jean jacket smelling like her, but what is that smell?
I can describe it, but I can't summon it back.
I'd be interested in seeing how Proust deals with smell.
In what sense is it an obstacle for him, or a means?
That's actually exactly where I should go. Wow.
When I say 'black, oozing, fetid discharge', why is it different from a brown one?
The two smell different.
But I'm not *smelling* them.
I just know they smell different.
I would never be able to entertain that they smell the same way.
Well, I can, but have they been colored with an odorless substance?
Why the hell would think along these lines to start? It's so unnatural.
I have to conceive of the scent as unaffected by the hue? No way.
Who's coloring this fetid discharge, anyway?
Totally implausible. The two sentences produce different impressions.
How the hell is this happening if I can't smell the two?
I know the *way* that each of the two should smell.
