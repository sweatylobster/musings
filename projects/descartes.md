# Possible introduction

Descartes has *two* proofs in the Meditations.

1. that the existence of the mind cannot be doubted, and that of the body can.
2. proof of the existence of God.

Though there's a centuries' established precedent to ignore the second, I choose to ignore it because it didn't cross my mind when conceiving of the project.
Descartes unfairly smuggled the sense of smell into the doubt of the body.
The historical success of the proofs do not govern their relevance to the project.
The proof for the existence of God, its structure and importance, is overwhelming.
Of the most importance, however, is that the project at hand came into view without ever trifling over the latter proof, but while obsessing over the mode of argumentation employed in the former.
We will investigate the oneiric origin of Descartes's proof of dualism.
By doing so,
That is, Descartes doubts the body and not the mind because *he* wakes up from *his* dream.

## Why I have been prepared to write this for years


### Old writings

<!-- ## Summarization of Descartes' mode of arguing -->
<!-- I persist through my dreams. -->
<!-- Hence I am a deceived apperception when I awaken. -->
<!-- I realize I wasn't really there, where my dream said I was. -->
<!-- I am certain, however, that it was *me* who experienced the dream. -->
<!-- I can't doubt that I exist -- *I* just woke up from *my* dream. -->
<!-- So if I exist even in my dreams, how could I doubt my mind's existence?-->
<!-- Hence my ego is continuous; and not subject to doubt. -->
<!-- The world, which enters but through my senses, is not continuous. -->
<!-- The senses are untrustworthy for at least half our lives. -->
<!-- Though I was at the beach, the beach never was. -->
<!-- Similarly, I never *actually* sustained the injuries in my nightmare. -->
<!-- So I can doubt the existence both of the world and the body. -->
<!-- The continuous me *would have to be wrong* about what exists at least half of the time. -->
<!-- Effectively, dualism states that the body can be doubted and the mind cannot. -->
<!-- The senses are to be doubted because belong to the body, after all. -->
<!-- Cette idee etrange a pour son origin le sens dans lequel il prend le ego reveur. -->
<!-- The origin of this idea is Descartes's comme il prend of the dreaming ego. -->
<!-- We suffer sensations while asleep and awake; half of the time, therefore, these aren't real. -->
<!-- But we persist throughout both states. -->
<!-- Therefore, the body (and senses, Descartes smuggles in) can be doubted, and the mind cannot. -->
<!-- We arrive at this conclusion by a peculiar path Descartes takes. -->
<!-- Descartes awakens from a dream to find he was asleep in front of his fire *the whole time!* -->
<!-- If the ego and its *cogitationes* did not persist in the dream state, this conclusion would not follow. -->
<!-- However, we would have to say that *all* of the senses yield *cogitationes* which stand in no necessary connection with the world. -->
<!-- For sight, sound, and touch, this holds, but does it for scent? -->
<!-- It's often overlooked that Descartes defines the body by what it is felt to be in dreams. -->


<!-- ## Descartes's way -->
<!-- This idea results from Descartes's mission to [place philosophy on sure grounds.](Crisis of the European Sciences, pp.75) -->
<!-- The truth of propositions admitted into philosophy must be 'clear and distinct.' -->
<!-- Such would be the ground for the metaphysical validity of the objective sciences. -->
<!-- In a word, the criterion is apodeicticity. -->
<!-- 'The transcendental motif' [Husserl speaks of](Crisis of the European Sciences, pp. 60, 75, 91, 97-98) is, in a word, apodeicticity. -->
<!-- The method is to subject everything to doubt and see what can't be doubted. -->
<!-- For example, we doubt that the body exists, which appears ridiculous. -->
<!-- But when we wake up from our nightmare, we're grateful it 'wasn't real.' -->
<!-- We have sense impressions, referred to our body, when we're awake *and* asleep. -->
<!-- That means that, half of the time, our senses are detached from nature. -->
<!-- That is, to *us* is reported a false state of affairs, half of the time. -->
<!-- So how can we trust something that's false half of the time? -->
<!-- And hence we doubt the senses. -->
<!-- The trouble with this is that dreams are not constituted by all senses. -->
<!-- For example, Descartes distinction between the mind and body depends on me *remembering* my dream. -->
<!-- This is not always the case. -->
<!-- [Les yeux c'est le corps.](https://youtu.be/anFzQ-FzpwA?t=564) -->
<!-- The eyes are the Cartesian body which invite doubt. -->
<!-- The noise is undefinable. -->
<!-- It's the current of our dreams and what rouses us to. -->
<!-- "Et le bruit..." ç'est le cours de nos rêves et çe qui nous reveille à la fois. -->
<!-- Il est soporifique autant qu'il est éclatant. -->
<!-- But why would this be necessary? What is dualism? -->
<!-- Descartes submits all cogitations to doubt. -->
<!-- When Descartes tries to doubt the existence of his mind, he fails. -->
<!-- In short, dualism is a falsification which has simplified the zetetic process. -->
<!-- In short, the lack of knowledge on scent for e -->
<!-- Descartes is the man we need to read to understand our heredity. -->





## Summarization of Descartes' mode of arguing
<!-- TODO: Re-read the meditations on first philosophy.-->
I persist through my dreams.
Hence I am a deceived apperception when I awake.
I realize that I was not really there.
Hence the untrustworthiness of the senses.

# I admire Descartes for the same reasons I object to him

My prejudice when first reading Descartes: he does not understand dreaming.
"It's just a stepping stone for his argument."
Now I see his mistrust of the senses as *fortunately* hasty.
Descartes opened up the world of the dreamer who walks by means of symbols.
Descartes is like a blind mountain hermit bounding from crag to crag without vertigo.
We grounded mortals complain about his foot placement while he shows us the dreamer's way of walking.
He's still blind, though. Algebra and *logistice speciosa* as braille.
If Descartes were careful, we wouldn't have anything miraculous.
He doesn't think about anything before he does it -- he just shows you how he walks, purely.
I mean, the guy is practically stammering when responding to his penpal Catherine.
That and the complete exposure of his Method.
So Descartes is the model for earnestness.

The Cartesian epoche has an oneiric origin.
For example, Freud's dream analysis method is a corollary to Descartes' discovery of the 'ego'.
That is, the 'ego' persists in dreams.
It is *I* who wakes up from the dream; I'm in the dream world at one time, and *then* the real world, in succession.
Then in the Kantian mode of speaking, the *a priori* intuition of time respects the periodicity of dreaming.
The transcendental unity of apperception is transcendental precisely because it is not annihilated by dreaming.
<!-- Can we identify Kant's 'transcendental unity of apperception' with Freud's 'ego'? Compare the two. -->
It is possibly strengthened. Each night of dreaming might be something of a war of identity.
"War is both father and king of all. It *revealed* the divine and the human, and made some free and others slaves."
The more one practices dreaming, the more one is perfected by it. Dreaming as our ego's perfection.
<!-- (But invoke Godard 2 or 3 things I know about her, quand le garçon pose la question: "maman, tu rêve parfois?":) -->
<!-- ("I used to wake up all at once. Not I feel like I'm missing pieces.") -->
<!-- (It could be we lose the battle. This helps to contextualize Bachelard's cogito of the dreamer, his Valery quote:) -->
<!--  -->
The proof that *we*, "le moi rêveur" do not live in the world is that we do not recognize we are dreaming.
Experience gives the world to the ego *via the imagination*.
Proof of the Kantian formal view by analyzing the phenomenology of dreaming.

## Themes

1. Various organs interact with truth differently (eyes-truth, nose-epistemology -- Cartesian )
2. 

## Projects
2. The nose will redeem epistemology by dreaming *awake* (Husserl, Baudelaire, Nietzsche)
6. Man the dreamer: Transcendental theme of the Cartesian epoche is arrived at by an interpretation of the dreaming man who awakens. Bad judgment about the senses--scent is clearly neglected. Impossibility of an epistemology which neglects the function of the nose in producing percepts for the dreaming ego. Time to wake up. "We are unknown to ourselves, we men of knowledge."
of nature spurs the mental instincts by repression to exert power

# Introduction

If olfactory phantasms cannot be reproduced, how *does* language excite olfactory impressions?
But definitely entropy with smell. Diffusion, etc.
Which senses can furnish apodeictic proofs?
I can't give myself evidence of what the smell is.
I can give myself of 11 being a prime number.
But the main point is you can't re-make/reproduce the scent itself.
Furthermore you can't smell anything in your dreams not from the world.
Descartes never realized this when he doubted all of the senses.

Descartes's mistake about the absolute ego is that he took *only what was apodeictic* as the indubitable.
But clearly the sense of scent, unarithmetical and impossible to conjure up as it is, doubtlessly applies to the external world.
I cannot disconnect the scent of popcorn with the most-just impulse to search for it.
I know it's here.
"But is it really here? Might I be deceived?"
Oh questionable question. Here we doubt the doubt.
And yet I cannot give proof.
When dogs smell us intently, they smell our real past, our history.
Their zetesis is the snout's dance/war with entropy.
"The curious dog wars with entropy."

The eddies and currents of entropy 
They swim upstream of entropy to reconstitute the past.
Entropy is like the water in time's river for a dog.

Dogs would have made a god of entropy right off the bat.
We're tardy. Most of us can't even smell God's decomposition.

<!-- How could we in good conscience (naively) deify aptly entropy? -->
<!-- Naively doesn't mean without skill. -->
<!-- It must not mean without science. -->
<!-- (Would that the reason for this commandment would flow as easily.) -->
