<!-- # Bachelard's "Poetics of Reverie" -->
<!-- I admire Bachelard's "*Cogito* of the Dreamer" in Poetics of Reverie. -->
<!-- It takes us way beyond my first step in the argument. -->
<!-- Dualism has an oneiric origin. -->
<!-- Descartes expresses doubt in the senses upon his rude awakening by his fireplace. -->
<!-- Where for others, this is a quaint rhetorical byway, it is for me the basis of the argument. -->
<!-- This section accomplishes a beautiful phenomenological examination of the self which can, and the one which cannot be recovered from sleep. -->
<!-- The essay is perfectly set up by the Valery quote. -->
<!-- "Sometimes I feel as if I were ?given? some other dreamer's dream" -->
<!-- The distinction between reveur and songeur blooms with its lawfulness through the whole passage. -->
<!-- An interpretive essay on Bachelard's accomplishments in this domain must not fail to be poetic itself. -->
<!-- How else but by dreaming with 'day grammar' would we know the work has found its mark? -->
