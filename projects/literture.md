# Short musings 4-13-23

People declaim literature in several, but typical, ways. 
"The author is indulgent."
This is fair.
Authors on average are.
But people ignore that masters resemble beginners in significant ways.
However annoying his style, the author may be presenting all details in the right places.
But they might be crappy, meaningless details.
How are we to tell if the details are meaningless?
Here is the artistry.
In any case, however bad an author's style is, he might be telling the story pretty well.
Let's ignore the vapid question of what the meaning of a story is.
It's boring.
Before sucking all the sensuality out of our topic, though, let's ask our question:
In real life, how do we realize what's going on?
That is, how do we finally put two and two together?
"My boyfriend's actually been a loser all along.";
"My girlfriend was cheating on me this whole time.";
or "My husband is actually gay."
Etc. These people all think:
"I don't know how I didn't see it sooner."
So now our question makes sense.
How do we put two and two together?
Obviously, we have to notice each symbol.
Then we assign to it a particular significance.
To do this, we have to assign it a significance in the context of other symbols.
A, b, c -- an alphabet of events.
These are all composed in a context, just like pronunciation. 
I.e. certain letters in different languages, like jz | cj in Polish, ge | ja in Spanish, ge | ja in German, etc.
The letters are identical. But are the symbols identical?
How does recollection function?
How does the way in which intentionality is presented presentation of literature?

## Abstraction
The order in which a story is told, the sequence of details related in a novel--
A person will notice signs without attributing a particular importance to them.
A novel does the same.
It gives an example of a person's intentionality.
For example, I notice the lights are off when I try and enter a room.
After a while, I take this to be regular.
But at what point does this become emblematic?
That is, I notice the lights are constantly turned off.
But do I notice thereby that the business is struggling?
Or how unfit management is?
Or that the management is incompetent and thinks it can stop from hemhorraging money with a few kilowatt minutes saved here and there?
I might, but this is not important.
What matters is that, eventually, I'll retrieve this memory, and I'll *use* it.
I'll employ this as a sign of something.
