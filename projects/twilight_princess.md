# Where did this come from?

This is connected to the argument in descartes.md :
I cannot disconnect the scent of popcorn with my conviction that it's somewhere around me.
The second I smell it, I search for it.
There is no doubt as to the justice of this.
Like we have in the propositions, scent does not admit of perspectival error.

## Digression on the ego in video games, transforming letting us(Link) use a dog's abilities for oneself (Linkself)
Playing as wolf link in Twilight Princess -- it's strange to be a creature which possesses these abilities.
The video game unites the two modes of perception in the player's hand.
There is no "I the player." same as there is no "my hand."
The only I is Wolf Link, who is also Human Link.
As far as the game's code and phenomenology can couple/correspond, the ego's a set of spatial coordinates.
I identify with the set of coordinates whose skeleton and textures I animate.
Perspective doesn't matter.
In Super Mario 64, you can see Lakitu in the mirror.
But even before you see the camera man's face, you don't confuse yourself with him.
You are the control stick. You are Mario.
The left thumb is the ego for several generations of players, now.
The left thumb is a key to empathy.
