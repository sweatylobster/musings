## My dispositions are why I'm repurposing the repository

I have two dispositions that hamper my productivity.
The first is working in excessive detail.
The second is abandoning projects before the sketch is complete.[^1]
My arguments are thus richly detailed and lead nowhere.
So I'm reorganizing this lotus-garden of a git repository project by project.

## Projects

1. Ethical action depends on the imagination (Peirce, Kant, Aristotle). Need to control imagination (by language). Language of morale, possibility, self-conception.
2. The nose will redeem epistemology by dreaming *awake* (Husserl, Baudelaire, Nietzsche)
3. Vita contemplativa is an essential possibility of a vital capitalist economy. (Smith, Aristotle) The philosopher is an efficient experimenter; by simplifying, and doesn't need to consider as much. Philosophers create radical changes in the conception of the world. Lavoisier's terminology cements notions, instantiates relations by suffixes, prefixes. How does Mendeleev's table anticipate all of the elements? (Schema.) The revolutionary conceptions simplify. However, not just anyone can productively contemplate. All men simplify at the end of their lives, but this is not wisdom or knowledge; it's merely generalization. But generalization is a tool. What kinds of philosophy lead to a pragmatic difference? Medicine, Aristotelian politics as the model philosophical practices. How has medical knowledge been advanced? What is the skill of philosophizing? Zetetic method of Plato, (c.f. Vieta). If we're worried whether the zetetic method has gotten us anywhere, look at Descartes's symbolic expansion of Galileo's application of the zetetic method in the realm of natural philosophy. One must be a productive philosopher. Skill as a philosopher. Philosophy advances human agency. Industrialization exploits knowledge.
4. Genealogical obligations and the need to revisit Pascal.
Using Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morals to redefine the need of the wager for God's existence (Nietzsche, Pascal)
5. The eyes can only avert testimony (Racine)
6. Man the dreamer: Transcendental theme of the Cartesian epoche is arrived at by an interpretation of the dreaming man who awakens. Bad judgment about the senses--scent is clearly neglected. Impossibility of an epistemology which neglects the function of the nose in producing percepts for the dreaming ego. Time to wake up. "We are unknown to ourselves, we men of knowledge."
of nature spurs the mental instincts by repression to exert power

## Themes of the projects

- Various organs interact with knowledge and truth differently
(Therefore there's a different taste or penchant for truth in each organ.)
(Phedre: Mais il en a les yeux, s'il n'en a le langage.)
(Baudelaire: )


## Topics
1. Psychology
2. Ethics
3. Phenomenology

5. Transcendental thinking

### Footnotes

[^1]
From Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics* [I. vi. 23]:

"The beginning is admittedly more than half of the whole,
and throws light at once on many of the questions under investigation."

δοκει γαρ πλειον η ημιου παντος ειναι η αρχη,
και πολλα συμφανη γινεσθαι δι' αυτης των ζητουμενον.

Setting ourselves up correctly is the most important effort to undertake.
But this also has to have an end.
Like he says, anyone can fill in the outlines (e.g. coloring books for children).
So get good at sketching completely *in one session*.
I'm good at zooming in on details (take the Greek above, and this footnote).
Work faster.
