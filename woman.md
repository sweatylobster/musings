The body's more sophisticated than a machine.
It's more ordered.
The need for Yoga and the disciplines of breath.
Complexity of the transactions in the body.

Women will never give up; they will play until death.
They are de-coupled from themselves, especially from their selves as players.
But what they play is a game with their womb and eggs.
Men play the game with that object as well.
Sperm are not a resource save for the struggle of the men, his potency, virility, agency, liveliness.
Confused, cannabis-infused sperm are tragically ugly.
It's crucial that woman be ignorant of herself as a player.
Liv Boeree -- such a feminine kind of excellence as a poker player.
The guys seem to have so few strats in comparison.
Pure gimmicks.
The point: a Nietzschian view of woman's self-ignorance.
Woman's psychological blind-spot: herself. 
Narcissus and Echo.
Man's psychological blind-spot: how inconsequential this ignorance is.
Danger of a rational (and trippy) woman.
What a psychologically adept woman can do.
In awe of that; I think of eros.
Boredom is lethal for a woman.
Boredom is the state a man, OTOH wants most to attain with a woman.
He would like to be bored with his supermodel wife, his mortgage, his dinners, etc.
It's not women who want consistency, but men.
And for very little effort.
E.g. A *man's* interest in a computer.
Men would rather have a hot woman as a constant in their romantic life.
But these men are living in fantasy-land. They ignore their conscience.
Men like me who are tortured by not having burned enough pour ces femmes redoutables.
But there are many (of these) that I know I outdo, and still more that I will outgrow.
Anyway.
What the men ignore is that the pangs of the woman's conscience for being with such a slob will be directed upon him.
Why do you think the Erinyes were women?  (eirene, peace)
How funny that Eyren taught me these lessons.
A woman can never really be satisfied; she can only be impressed.
Her homeostasis is to be in a state of admiration, like my mother who still loves and desires my father.
Can I ever keep an Eyren in my life?
What do I have to be?
What do I have to sacrifice? What become?
How exercise?

I think too much about these women.
Jesus.
A man's ignorance has to be both deliberate *and* sane.
Opium of a relationship as it begins... it is the woman's lack of self-confidence.
She has "chosen" to fight from under.
She knows she can do it; her organism, anyway.
Things are only easy for a man at first because a woman is not honest.
And there's a species of honesty I can't be happy expecting from a woman.
(Rather am I pleased to see it so persistently thwarted.)

## Faithfulness is boring; jealousy is another interesting erotic challenge

Do men really want a faithful woman?
Nobody *wants* a slut.
Just like sloppy men, they miss the point of their gender. 
They misunderstand what they've been given, what their mission or struggle is.
There's no meaningful challenge for these people.
