The nature of a woman is to make man think about her.
This is her care for truth.
Would that all of his attention be true to me.
The romantic goal of a man is to know all women.
This is his desire for truth.
Would that all of my thought be true of her.
Both women and men generalize in romance, but it's not males that stop females from generalizing.
Men therefore derive actionable power from generalizations.
Women do not.
They become bitter.
Men do as well.
Men can cast off a weight via concepts, but this is to become spiritually weaker.
Parable of the talents, mixed with notion of a butterfly's cocoon.
But more on women halting men.
Women'll do anything to make a man into a klutz.
This is incredibly useful to bludgeon a man's spirit, goals, and sexuality.
Husbandry of the livestock via their wives.
The wives are simple, too.
But a man's determinations about himself are the most dangerous thing.
The mark of a man's power comes through via his apperception.
Women select for the force of a man's apperception.
It is what makes all knowledge possible, after all.
Woman is a simple riddle.
To see underdeveloped women -- they are so little without the spirit.
Would that my thought be too much for a woman to behold.
Would that the truth be misogyny.
Would that the truth sting and spur the horses and dancers.
Among us, we'll find very few.

## On death and anxiety
Women are anxious to receive my love why?
RULE 1: Do not date anyone beneath you.
Correlated precept: recall you are higher than all others.
For a humorous ethic: gain from all of the refutations to this.
RULE 2: Do not have sex with uninitiated women.
RULE 3: Have sex with very few women.
Adopt new habits:
 - do not tip,
 - do not smile,
 - yet be generous.
What Tarquinius Superbus said by means of the poppies in the garden, the son understood, but the messenger did not.
To be the messenger.

### Obstacles and clarification
Nice smile with a woman earlier.
She was older.
Thank god.
Older women only.
But not Jeanette, I lost interest.
RULE 4: Never do women favors.
Do not have sex with women under 30.
You're too young.
Once you're making money next year, you can tolerate a couple of 25 year old idiots.
For now, you have too much to focus on.
The largest problem is love.
You do not know how to break a woman's heart gracefully.
You are not practiced in the skill of breaking a woman's heart.
This is a skill worth being graceful at.
The only difference in closing the door and slamming it is *how* it's done.
Never abstain from the action.
An action is a representation which is judged based on the way it enters the intuition and mingles with concepts.
To avoid a judgment, it's necessary only for the representation to mingle with other concepts, and be unified under a different rule.
This should happen only by the valence of the representation, to bind with other concepts and rules.
You can get away with anything being generous.
Te nace.
RULE 5: Exploit your intellect.
RULE 6: Exploit your anonymity.
RULE 7: Exploit your ability to act.
