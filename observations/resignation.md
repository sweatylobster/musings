# On vanity
A young man acts as if he possesses self-knowledge.
This is the first form of his vanity.
When this vanity is mixed with a critical eye, it becomes a skill by the name of pride.
A man's pride is his height.
His highest fruits will emerge from the point of his pride.
Therefore a man would do well to ripen along this axis.
## On caution
Young men generally act well out of vanity; and so do young women.
A young woman will be flattered and seduced by compliments.
More accurately, she is seduced by her vanity.
A man will try his hand at a difficult task, and find himself to be worth it.
In truth, he is worthy of his vanity.
We are set beautiful and lofty goals by our vanity.
So it seems nature guides us well.
We test the mettle of our vanity in romance.
This is where vanity is most excellent and salubrious.
## On morals
Nevertheless, people speak of vanity as a sin.
This simply means "it misses the mark". Hamartia.
But we just said vanity makes us attain greater heights.
Therefore vanity can only be a sin if self-elevation is off target.
This is precisely the case.
Vanity is an aristocratic emotion.
We pursue the completion of beautiful romantic goals by vanity.
Vanity is always felt as a negotiation with society to recognize our rightful place in it.
We owe our discontent to the false perception society has of our standing in it.
Vanity is a vital force which is a social bargaining chip wagered in the negotiation
for a higher, truer place in the social hierarchy.
It defines our habitat.
We define a sexual-ethical ecosystem by exercising it.
This is why there is no sex-ethos currently -- vanity has no social role whatsoever.
A Charles Fourier, a Marquis de Sade, etc. are unthinkable.
There is no morality around sex at the moment.
People are merely struggling with the echoes of shame.
"For centuries after his death Buddha's shadow was shown in a cave." TGS Book III 108
"After Buddha was dead, his shadow was still shown for centuries in a cave -- a tremendous, gruesome shadow."
"God is dead; but given the way of men, there may still be caves for thousands of years in which his shadow will be shown."
"--And we--we still have to vanquish his shadow, too."
A historical materialist account of this would be interesting.
But more interesting would be to do the "Nietzsche beat you to the punch, pal" kind of essay.
The Genealogy of Morals type of essay.
The "enough with these niaseries" type of essay.
You know. Anyway;
There's not even self-interest with respect to sex proper.
Self-interest has rendered sex an instrument for acquiring resources.
This is prostitution, and vanity plays no role in prostitution,
neither for the prostitute, the pimp, or the client.
The only "vanity" is of being, leasing, or having consumed choice meat.
Neither on the product's side, the producer's side, or the consumer's side.
In the current sex-ethos of prostitution -- which is a 
Where there is no habit, or ethos, of sexuality, there's a purely contractual and formal sexual relation.
A habit of sex can be as simple as liking a vibrator, liking anal, etc. -- things which are a matter of taste and experience. 
You can only develop taste after having several safe experiences.
For example, nobody has a taste of poisonous mushrooms.
If people develop a *taste* for this, it's really an encyclopaedic knowledge of lethal mycelia.
Maybe this can form a "poisonous mushroom aesthetic," which sounds really cute, actually.
Please give me credit if you make this a brand.
Anyway -- if you don't have taste, you can only have superficial knowledge of a thing.
And sex is not possible to objectify, save through experiences.
The animals that do have sex, however, are much easier to objectify.
Therefore, in the absence of a habit of sex, or a sex-ethic -- and I am really talking about a *way* of having sex which would be better than other ways -- one makes sex an instrument, or exchanges something else for sex.
It becomes a commodity, in short.
This is the birth of the resentment of the sexes.
Only the sexless without sexual habits view the dangers of hookup culture.
Men and women who are spiritually well-developed navigate these dangers in a much more interesting way.
They do not seem to lose control.
Naturally, they try to avoid ennui, emptiness, etc.
But they certainly do not view it contractually.
Only the rich view it contractually, and for different reasons than plebeians view sex contractually.
The aristocratic as well as the plebeian have something to gain from such a contractual relation.
But more precisely -- the aristocratic cannot suffer to squander that which has been in the process of cultivation for various centuries.
Therefore, the marriage-contract in ambitious families is not a sex-ethos, but an extension of a political-genealogical program.
It's entirely unlike a plebeian marital contract.
Nevermind that the rich might supply a generous dowry, and the poor a generous yet still wanting dowry.
Nevermind, too, that there are no *explicit* dowries to-day.
The fact still stands that there are economic considerations that preclude a social ethics of sex.
But is still the case?
Haven't economic conditions changed considerably?
Is it not possible for the first time to have a social ethics of sex?
Or any number of them?
Truly these could be cultivated in a non-tribal way.
Yet, in the absence of any real negotation of what one deserves romantically and sexually, people revert to the instrumental appraisal of sex, especially women.
Men throw up their hands and decide to make a lot of money.
This is totally beside the point.
The fact is that ugly societies view marriage contractually for different reasons than aristocratic societies.
The latter will not easily squander the power their families have cultivated and carefully augmented for centuries. 
The former need to get these unruly youngsters off of their hands.
They are a vital and psychological burden on the house (oikos) as they continue to stagnate.
This is only compensated for as they begin to contribute the *the* house.
The origin of the economy is the house, whose origin is genital.
Vanity negotiates for a better house by negotiating for a more beautiful mate.
### The current situation
Vanity is in fact a yoke.
We have 
In fact -- what role does vanity play in the Narcissus and Echo story?
It stages a romantic tragedy from the typical sympathetic point of view of Echo.
Sympathizing with Narcissus is practically useless.
But 
In the current virtual-sexual market which has been divested of all authentic criticism and negotiation, vanity is an anti-negotiator.
Maybe previous generations pitied Echo like I do.
But now neither sex seems capable of being either Narcissus or Echo.
That is -- neither sex is capable either of an authentic self-obsession, or an obsession with another person.
Can anyone really love herself?
I'd say that self-love is a tragic and pitiful self-deception.

Ennui is no longer a foil behind the jewel of love.
It tears through love's fabric.

I hear a caricature of a sexless androphobe in my mind
These romantic goals are not selfish.
They are mating rituals.
Mating rituals are not selfish.
But there is no alternative to the height attained by the vanity we just spoke of.
But -- there is no alternative when we reason as we just have.
Therefore, to say what's right, we ignore what's moral.
We look at reality, and what we observe materially.
Vitalistic science.
We have to reason backwards from the way men and women *tend* to be.
We have to distinguish mores and nature.
The goal is to get these kids to reproduce
The exception is being flattered and then tricked. 
And so deception is the first named danger in a young person's education.
"Don't be too trusting, don't talk to strangers, etc..."
## On resignation
Young men act as though they were free of vanity's pernicious effects.
It's simple for them to criticize women for their vanity.
It's the lowest hanging fruit of women they criticize.
But men have a different species of vanity.
I would hate to continue with any argument that could be used to make a man ashamed, or feel clumsy. 
This is a woman's argument -- her project of domestication.
Nevermind this question, or what a man's project is. 
Resignation in a young man is more vain than any female expression of vanity.
There are no older men who proffer their resignation.
And true -- it is a sign of 
Resentment breeds a cheap kind of vanity.

They focus on the presence of vanity in women.
Naturally, this isn't conducive to a study of the human.
So we ignore resistance to this notion, namely, that men are vain by resignation.
