Honestly, this isn't a very easy topic.
Why are people so good at coercing data from others? 
You buy *one thing* at a store, walk out, go home, wake up, brush your teeth, and find they've bombarded you with e-mails.
Yes, you voluntarily entered the information, but it's not deliberately that you did that. 
Aristotle's Ethics is important on this point.
One shares information to --> (why)?
The to is the basis of rational action.
It's an *insane* piece of grammar.

## Taking stock
Asking how people juice data, and we got a profound result on a particle.
Two sentences.
1. One shares information why?
2. One shares information to why?
I get the impulse to correct #2 to "One shares information for what (reason)?"
This is better style -- but -- here's something linguists that only ever read neglect:
it's an okay sentence with the right delivery, the right rhythm.
"One shares information to -- (well!..?) \*\**headspazz*\*\* why?"
It cannot but elude your understanding lest you surrender to its cadence. 
Same thing as that last sentence.
Very precise -- has to be delivered in a kinda stuffy way.
But the thought is well-rendered in't.

"To" captured my attention because I [wrote recently that infinitives don't show up in programming.](~/musings/programming/starting.md)
So I thought it interesting that something so crucial to explaining why something should be done -- i.e. for the sake of what --
