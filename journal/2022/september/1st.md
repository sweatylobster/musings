# DeepMind, Demis's type of intelligence

Demis Hassabis -- his intelligence eludes me.
I can't sense how clever or intelligent he is, nor in what way.
I don't see him as *philosophically* clever.
He does not beg to be read in an esoteric way.
This manner of reading apparently is not one which he presents familiarity with.
His ear is altogether different from mine. 
He is doubtless a better chess talent than I am, and far more accomplished.
It's a question of musicality; I admire Pat's genius more than any other musician's.

As for the esoteric:
Euclid, Plato, certainly, Aristotle less so, Rousseau, Descartes certainly, Pascal less so...
(I think Pascal too frank, too sincere, too cordial. His is the only genuine cordiality.)
His concept of the heart eludes even Klossowski, Deleuze, et al. in their explicit productions.
There is only ever *room* for the heart; it is not itself treated.
Heidegger, too, is deaf to the pitch of the tightrope Pascal walked.
Perhaps -- because he never fell off it.
Pascal is the loneliest philosopher.

Nietzsche's a philosopher of the gut.
That and the lungs.
Hence his sense of smell.




On Cary Stickney's presence:
I remember his book opened right to the 240s, exactly where I wanted to be.
He had to show me through that quickly, ver(s) quickly, not neg-electing to dance through it.
(and Lise van Boxel's as well)
you do honor to the phantoms by fighting on the battlefield, Achilleus.
Rumination does no service to the narrative, not to the past, etc.
Pursue your perfection, your completion -- in failure.
A strain, to strain; the pitch, to pitch.
To be cursed is agency itself.
Overburdened with levity, the spirit found in carnal disarray;

I am not her favored living body.
Do I want to be haunted by her love, dead or alive?
Yes. I simply do lover,
