The formatting in here hardly matters. These are thoughts that have no place other than in the musings folder, on the particular day on which hey werewritten. They are meant only for the mechanical regulation of a train of thought -- or is there any other way f regulating a trayne of thought? What are my goals? I close my eyes and I imagine myself capable of doing what? Perhaps not that I am capable, but that I am currently practicing the things which I want done -- this I want as a condition and practice of my whole life. For me, this is happiness. I think I am a more conscientious person than I had assumed. My mother assumes very little of herself as a writer and I fear that I may appear as simple to the profound. Then again the profound are not healthy or sexier per se. I hope that I can give up playing video games. I hope that I can dedicate myself to my dreams. I am too much in adoration of images and eikasia to want to do something other than image-making. I started to love the looking at MGSV again, and started re-seeing the magic. There is nothing in the game, it's all in me. Of course, the game is made with the attention and care to be able to sustain this much adoration for the images it readily produces (it's obvious how different Death Stranding is supposed to be; prone is so meaty and interesting in MGSV!) 

I want to make music videos, not necessarily to my own music, or with my own videos.
