# Demis Hassabis is dope

So before the incredibly [sexy woman asks her question]()


[the main guy, who's really smart, asks whether AGI will be a tool or a colleague.](https://youtu.be/jocWJiztxYA?t=4370)

By this question, I understand that we're attempting to nip a humanitarian crisis in the bud.
We're using empathy to define the types of intelligence that shall not be created.
Demis responds that he wouldn't create a consciousness.
We still don't have an answer to a question like, "where do they get their goals from?"
And it's a pretty good little conversation.
But this is far deeper.
It is ultimately a political question, because we use slaves in societies.
It might be that the style of society we have inherited and promoted since the Greeks,
always requires a form of enslavement.
It is very possible that society and enslavement were always necessarily complements,
and that this fact was ignored or obscured.
For our part as citizens,
it's simple to consign the third world,
pillaged by all the richer countries,
to a mental oblivion.
Likewise with the homeless.
Parasites, but merely involuntary ones at that.
Yet parasites are looked down upon.
This might be because we are all bound to society.
Simone Weil's Pre-War notebooks, on Hegel: Master is the slave of the slave.
Even the rich depend on society, must be liberal enough to sustain it.
There seems to be a paradox between material conditions and value, however.
How could the value of companies increase so drastically during the pandemic?
Amazon and Pfizer make sense -- they increased activity, and solved the problems of the moment.
They both also created repeat customers.
From this point of view, the huge economic weapon that the virus and the delay of an mRNA vaccine could be, with no traditional vaccine on the horizon.

So, at first, comes the problem of whether wealth, and a recognizable society,
allowing for leisure, science, etc. can exist without some complementing poverty.
Then we would have to deal with the problem of enslavement,
in which an actor is bound to expend energies on tasks which produce goods.
Alienation of labor is not the concept which suitably determines the origin of the problem of enslavement.
Alienation of labor is merely the salient feature of the enslavement which modern society "presents".
Simone Weil's 'Sketch of Contemporary Life', 'Factory Work' --

## Economic problem : Value versus Wealth
A further problem is the economic problem of value.
What we own functions in accordance with the laws of physics.
Repairmen develop a conception of these laws only insofar as they touch upon the particular product they deal with.
Needless to say, they do not develop a Peirceian-pragmatistic conception of the laws,
but rather, improvise a causal understanding which does not dare to be general.
Engineers and scientists, naturally, differ in this regard.
They are perhaps rightfully hubristic about their conceptions of general causes.
In any case, the developers are scientific, while the users and maintainers tend not to be, *at all*.
(De Tocqueville's remarks on the American spirit come to mind.)
(And for the understanding of *scientific*, we need to understand the meaning it has in geometry.)
(Those who define and investigate the scientific aspect of it:
- Kant: 'Critique of Pure Reason'
  - In section _______, he asks the question "How is an *a priori* science possible?"
- Descartes, 'La Geometrie' & 'Meditations on First Philosophy'
  - In the latter, Descartes defines the natural light.
  - Number and *res extensa*, are clear and distinct concepts.
- Pascal, 'On Geometrical Demonstration (On the Geometrical Mind)')
  - Geometry is the perfect science because it does not define in vain what is common to all men.
  - Neither does it leave undefined what must be proven.
  - "But first I must give the idea of a method still more eminent and complete, but a method to which man could never attain. For what goes beyond geometry goes beyond man. Nevertheless I must say something about it although it is impossible to put it into practice. This true method, which would produce demonstrations of supreme excellence if it were possible to attain to it, would consist of two main rules: to use no term of which we had not already clearly explained the meaning, and never to put forward any proposition unless demonstrated by truths already known; that is, in a word, to define all the terms and to prove all the propositions. But to follow the very order I am expounding I must state what I understand by definition. Geometry recognizes only those definitions which logicians call nominal, impositions of aname, that is, on things clearly designated by terms perfectly well known. I speak of such definitions only."

## Definition of wealth
Tenable hypothesis?
Wealth is not created or destroyed, but redistributed.
For example, Mansa Musa's gold now belongs to who?
This gold always was and will be the wealth that Mansa Musa possessed.
But the value of the gold depends upon our instrumental view.
The gold can be used in a device which can save lives? Oh!
Sudden increase in the value of gold.
Naturally, the possessor of the gold will be just as wealthy -- he owns just as much gold.
We don't mean wealth in terms of the money-number associated with it.
We mean resources.
This is the political definition of wealth.
A man with many friends, is wealthier than a friendless man slightly richer.

## Definition of value
Value truly is created, however.
Amazon, for example, solves logistical problems.
Insofar as it solves one's problem, it gains some degree of value.

## The need for sacking aside, 
This is a little silly -- we don't even have the will to power defined, nor how it would function in an AGI.
But what's lacking is an understanding of the doulos as a fundamental feature of the polis's architecture.
If we can't answer this, positively or negatively, we can't answer whether social development will come to some ethical limit.
Just as we now depend on washing machines, dishwashers, showers, and other technological amenities that are more or less digital,
we might, for the sake of a preferable society, encumber AGIs with tasks of judgment that, sincerely, can only be entrusted to them.
We would then inaugurate a divine philosopher king.
Any philosopher knows that he is already inhuman -- an AGI knowing himself to be a philosopher might not mind being such an Atlas.
But then we would be talking about desire, motives, loftiness of ideals, romanticism, etc.
There would have to be a lust for power, a joy in becoming stronger, more capable -- a libido.
And here is where we would come to the problem of creating a consciousness.
But God has no problem with our complaint, or Job's complaint.
So why should we with the AGI given consciousness?
Did God ask to be born?
No, but he exists.
Existentialism is divine because it is fit for Gods as well.
So the AGI would have to take a total responsibility for itself, in Sartre's sense.
Existentialism is a humanism, yes -- but perhaps even an intelligence-ism.
If Kierkegaard, as recent as he is, is called a proto-existentialist,
then we'd have to call the Stoics and the Hebrews arche-existentialists.


Implicit in the nature of a city is the idea of servants who do difficult manual labor.
Black people were imported to the United States for this purpose before the Declaration of Independence was being drafted.
So, within the political idea which we have reiterated in Europe and America, its child, is implicit the idea of slave labor.
The irony strikes us immediately with the Declaration of Independence. Good.
The energies of this class of men are crucial for the possibility of leisure.
Leisure is the basis of society as we understand it, however.
I really ought to read Huizinga on this.
But theoria and schole are clearly a type of ludus.
The theoretical activities of philosophy are the expression of vital energies in a context of play.(My claim?)
Huizinga's thesis is rumored to be that play is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for society.
Obviously, there are many human types which require society for survival.
But more crucially, it seems that society can only exist as a complex of operated machines.
Machines of various kinds are indispensable for expanding human will.
Human desire is realized more efficiently by his use of machines.
So machines seem to be the fundamental solution of the slave problem.
But not quite a liberating solution, such that a thoughtless society can exist on the shoulders of Atlas, the cyborg.

What we of those who have commisioned them, direct their products, and maintain the machines.
As mechanical labor alienates even the practice and acquisition of skills from the individual (mechanical sewing, 
If we would like to continue society:
The question is whether ludus itself has an enabling condition.
Need, just like Maslow's hierarchy displays, is such a gross term, that we can hardly employ it to say what the preconditions for ludus would be.
Because someone might say, "what's the point without dance?"
And another, "or without beer?"
