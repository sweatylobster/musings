The problem is remaining free.
To be free is to be rational to one's own ends.
If desires are implanted in me, then the ends of others can be fulfilled through my satisfaction of alien desires.
If others can motivate my actions, I am not free.
If others can assure my inaction, I am not free.
If others anticipate my rebellion/unpredictability, I am not free.
(Evasive maneuvers or flares? Forget cost: stay alive.)
To be free is to be rational to *my* ends.
I am reason in this case. (Hegel's definition in the Philosophy of History.)
In order to fulfill my ends well, I must endorse shame.
If I do not have a free relation to my own shame, I cannot reflect upon the meaning of my actions.
If my actions do not have a meaning to me, I am not a free actor.
Either we act justly, or justify what we've done. (L->R | R->L)
One always justifies with authority, implicit or explicit.
If shame isn't repressed outright, we can relate to past actions with the dignity of rationality.
To relate to past actions as always justified, because they were authorized by our hand, is to depend on a hierarchy of order, authority. Aren't these, ultimately, interchangeable?
But what meaningful alternative is there?
If reason and freedom consists in electing, the alternative is the elected authority.
Might is right, iff it convinces reason.
Criterion -- That the force of propositions overwhelm reason, make it assent or genuflect.
E.g. chess players saying "I see your argument."
Movements have a rationale; reason is their force.
The movements realize a motive, enact a plan, a dessein.
The force of the plan is not Reason's (Vernunft) always.
Phedre perhaps out of guilt feels that she is possessed by a God.
But she does take responsibility over her sin, une flamme si noire.
But still, the wine-woman Oenone seduces Phedre to enact what occurs to Phedre.

O: Hippolyte! Grands Dieux!
P:                           Ce toi qui l'a nomme.

Mais ni Phedre ni Oenone n'entendent pas ce que Phedre avait dit dans 363:

He bien! ``a tes conseils je me laisse entrainer.
Vivons, si vers la vie on peut me ramener,
Et si l'amour d'un fils en ce moment funeste
De mes faibles esprits peut ranimer le reste.

There is no anxiety of meaninglessness if we see our freedom at stake. It would be more meaningless to be an indentured critic than to be ashamed of a past crusade. Don Quijote vs. Alonso Quijada, vs. Cide Hamete Benengeli vs. Sancho Panza, vs. Cervantes. Plato vs. Socrates. Socrates in Phaedrus talking of love under the Platonos tree, his tunic covering only his head -- (out of 'shame!').


If I can't act confidently, and be embarrassed by not *actually* knowing the world, I can't reap the benefits of intuition.

with the possibility of shame justifying them is to secure dignity through rationality,


# Control of behavior via emotional resonance

What is behavior? It answers to the body of each animal which behaves in a certain way. Hektor descends upon the fallen Patroklos like a lion contesting the boar for his spring. 


How do beliefs modulate action? Not every action answers to an explicit belief. If an action is not habitual, it's (emotionally) motivated. Beliefs help to make habits. Therefore habits We adopt beliefs that resonate with our emotions. Our emotions are our instrument, are our chords.

# The use of shame in maintaining independence, control over one's emotions
Shame, when directed by oneself towards one's own actions and beliefs -- is the possibility of freedom. One comes into a totally free relation with *power*, since one's ashamed precisely on the misuse of power in some other case. If I had a chance at some gorgeous girl, and only now realize how I messed it up, I come into a free relation with my ability to act now. The important thing with shame is not to settle prematurely on some nihilistic constellation of meaning. "Girls are like..." If anything, patient optimism will always see actuality more clearly than nihilism -- for things *actually are*.
