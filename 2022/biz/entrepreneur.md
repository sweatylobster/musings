# Where the hell does money come from?

Somebody prints money. Money is demanded to value/trade valuables. There is a server and a client. Income is always given by a client. The entrepreneur receives the income from the client. If their reputation is good, or if the business-model demands, payment is received in advance. 

# Definition of the entrepreneur

The entrepreneur faces expenses alone; selects dependable instruments to avert/minimize risk. These instruments are dependable by wage contracts. Business is negotiation, and better entrepreneurs are better negotiators. People can always negotiate rates -- having a reservation price is always a viable strategy. Entrepreneur receives most compensation for providing the end to which laborers work. That there are materials to adapt and prepare by workers is what justifies the entrepreneur's entitlement to the majority of profit. We don't suspend Locke's definition of labor-value in paying her out; she is compensated for her executive function. To borrow a concept from Ford Doolittle, the entrepreneur writes a song the employees sing. Any choir can perform the rehearsed song -- any audience member can recognize the song. The employees are not essential to the concept of the song in the abstract. They are rather its activity, its execution. 

# The entrepreneur neither expert nor learner. 

The entrepreneur is typically charismatic. He must be sure of his judgment, and not show signs of insecurity -- it's bad for morale. As such, the entrepreneur is not unlike the general -- his is the last word.

Customarily, the entrepreneur is decidedly against logical rigor, leaving logistical 'squabbling' to mere specialists, mere technologists.
Under what conditions of logistical independence is this attitude permissible?

The technologists must be capable of determining the task. (Peter F. Drucker - The Knowledge Worker)
They must both be autonomous, and know how to optimize their own productivity.

is somewhat ironic since The logical clarity of employees and specialists in *a priori* matters uniquely optimizes (arithmetical) logistics. The larger a company, the greater the expenses incurred by operation. For large businesses, mathematical accounts of logistical optimization become indispensable. The least inefficiency is shown to be ridiculously costly on monthly balance-sheets. More on mathematics later. The entrepreneur's labor is of designating necessary tasks. So the entrepreneur issues a logistical plan which brings income under certain conditions. Managers hired ensure that the conditions obtain.

# Relation of the entrepreneur to managers 

Where entrepreneurs assemble laborers, managers direct their energies according to logistical requirements. The closer the managers are to implementing logistical plans of their own, the more credit they should receive for generating income, (by Locke's definition of labor-value) which is the struggle of being a conscientious entrepreneur. It could even be that managers are responsible for hiring, if their executive function is well-aligned with the logistical problem of income, generation of revenue. In a company whose managers lack executive function, the entrepreneur both assembles and schedules; in a company where the entrepreneur does both, the managers are hardly more than veteran employees (high-myelin). 


Laborers complete tasks according to {pride, myelin, health, energy}. These internal limitations stand in the way of "delivery" more so than external limitations, which is the reason the entrepreneur (supreme executive function) is usually the one hiring: consistency, dependability are for the sake of minimizing internal limitations, and therefore ensuring a consistent degree of instrumentality. The external limitation to a task's completion is the physical/material problem, which is a matter of mechanics that remains known in the equation of making income. "We know it takes a month for us to get this permit. Business as usual." Or: ""  It falls to a manager to ensure that the energies of laborers are at all times logistically required. Each employee is a logistical operator of an organ in a synchronized organism.

# Mathematical sophistication of the entrepreneur's plan

## External limitations of logistical realization

# Political | Social

This is the unique terrain of the business. People who have "been in the industry," or who "know the lay of the land" understand just these external limitations. "One can't expect a response from (x) before a week, because it's just the way the business works. Idk man, processing time, or whatever." Here, we do need an *a posteriori* science of the business, since it's political.

# Physical | Mechanical

The clearest example is in construction: There is a limit to the amount of Joules a team can expend in an 8-hour shift. Similarly, concrete takes a given amount of time to dry. That is, the building is realized in a sequence, and the pace of the steps depends on limitations of physics. Fortunately, we are accustomed to quantizing these physics-mechanics factors of realization.

# How does this guy gain from mathematical specificity again?

"Who knows what they'll do?" Physics and chemistry are supremely powerful how...? Experimental education via the military. Isn't it curious that nobody is evaluated by psychological metrics of social responsibility, empathy, ethic -- etc. -- when receiving certification to practice as an engineer? Why is it that these men are given so much trust, when they have such great power to create dangerous, unsound structures?

Vieta's Isagoge specifies the regulated significance of the transformation of mathematical identities, which may be always articulated by a number representing an unknown in closely inscribed proximity with a known. If the inference here is always regulated, it should be valid provisionally, and its significance always possible to interpret. If we trust inferences represented by formal changes, then we should trust the representation of  formal representation of the mathematical chains from here should therefore concern ourselves with refining if not expanding our arithmetical evaluation of sensible quantities (which expand to insensible limits!). Music is charming in its way of exploring limits.

The appropriate, or responsible construction, can always be determined algebraically. Algebra is the logistic of signs which formally cannot apply in equivocal ways. We secure the possibility of powerful, valid inference by submitting the experience of nature to the formal, algebraic expression of a status quo. 

These men are trusted so much to be rational to the articulated desires of others, which may be evaluated in terms of realizability, not owing to any consideration of their special nature; the "specious logistick" is tantamount to social responsibility. It is with only minor edification of the engineer's ethic that he can bring the sufficiency of the specious logistick to realize an engineer to competently practice the responsible designation of materials and interacting/ensuing forces to 



So he hires agents to do what must be done. His competence as entrepreneur lies in the fulfillment of his role of understanding the logistics of the project's realization. The entrepreneur as a logician: once the operands are clearly defined, to contract by a wage the appropriate operators.

#

Therefore, the timeline of the project's realization is chiral: on the one hand it is the labor-effort, and hence a wage-sum, and on the other the mathematical expression of forces in their algebraic bearing upon edification/construction. of By a quantification of forces required to effect the envisioned product, the role of the skilled laborer's intuition is demystified. We identify this clarity with science, and even went so far as to make his highly-attuned nervous system interchangeable with a well-programmed automaton following conditional statements. Science, under this definition, was demonstrated to make a better entrepreneur, because it gave him the capacity to articulate the new-found awareness in the form: this myelinated nervous-system is not the cause; the force, in this quantity, applied in this orientation, is the cause. This science, being based on physics, as it applies to practical application, is no different from engineering. Since business is entirely a matter of uncertainties, a quantification, and confidence is wanting in all businessmen, a formal appreciation of odds of success would grant the entrepreneur greater patience in the face of adversity -- if only those formally valid predictions do have a bearing on empirical fact.

Yet, from the same source, we've also established that the entrepreneur is absolutely justified in saying: "I can't afford to spend time learning mathematics, I need to spend my time solving [what no one else can solve]." Is there not some solution? Well, to what problem?

# The singularity of the entrepreneur's judgment

For reasons accidental and deliberate, the entrepreneur is obliged to face his problems alone. Firstly, taking others into his confidence costs time, whose value is often greater than the confidant's proposed solution. If such a confidant *is* capable of counseling him, he seems either to be his competitor or advisor. In either case, the entrepreneur will sustain an injury: in the former case, to the efficiency of his business; in the latter, to his pride.

# Objective in writing

It's the aim of this article to propose a means of lessening the burden upon the average entrepreneur, in no way done by shifting the fulcrum of his responsibilities. In fact, to do so would so decrease both the gravity and dignity of the entrepreneur's station, as to make it seem identical with that of the employee's. He would be hard-pressed in such a circumstance to stave off a well-justified mutiny.

I propose, instead, a means of externalizing and emending his unique judgment.


# The entrepreneur's unique situation; entrepreneur as captain

The entrepreneur's unique share in the company's fortune is owed to his extreme responsibility over the company's fate. He embodies the apparatus of judgment in the Leviathan he has assembled, whose condition thereby determines his psychological and financial condition: as profits and joy accrue in good times, so equally does his misery and stress in those unfavorable. Because of his extreme responsibility, the weight of his conscience will compel him to close the business when it fares poorly -- for who could understand him? A man in such a desolate state wishes only to nullify the principle of the business's failure; is he not, like Job, justified in feeling this? As is only right, the business closes and the limbs seek another master to direct them. 

To manage this is required either the drunken bravado of the Winter Army (that faction of WWII which sustained the greatest number of casualties) or the terrifying calculus of Odysseus, who, as the viscera of his men plummet back out of the darkness to paint the hull of his boat with slick chunks of red, their screams reverberating incessantly throughout the cave, he regulates by his own echoing speech those still rowing, never faltering in the confidence of his choice to enter the cave, when the circumstance of which he was forewarned, is brought presently to bear upon all of his senses. 

Only God is capable of inspiring that terror in Job. The role of terror for an upright leader must be made clear before we begin, and this be achieved only by means of poetic imagination. For the pitiful, the inconsolable who do not shudder, ([deilos](https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/3722) kai adeinos), who feel no terror symmetrical in kind to Odysseus's, there is yet another method I propose. The use of externalized judgment which has anticipated loss arithmetically.

If one should doubt the value of the essentially arithmetical method proposed, consider that the warning given to Odysseus mentioned that Scylla had six (6) limbs, but that Charybdis would destroy the whole (1) ship. Had Odysseus never received a representation of the events to come, he might well have followed the calculus of common sense: " *obviously*, you stay in the light and steer clear of the cave! Are there even whirlpools that big?"

Yes. And never mind that a blind man is telling you this story.

Had this layman survived, would it not have been out of cowardice? Such a man is [deilos](https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/3722), because circumstance, the force majeure, splits his judgment in two. Upon his undignified return, would he, if able to curb his desire for bourbon and wine, not be both pitiful and inconsolable, and worst of all, permitted to be so? He is a hypocrite, who, by definition, find their highest significance in the audience's appraisal of them (under judgment/playing a part). Odysseus is not split in twain because his very commanding is the incorporation of his terror.
