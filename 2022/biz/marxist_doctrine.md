Look -- if Marx wasn't worth shit, why badmouth him?
Marx gave us useful structures for rational manipulation.
What is the rational purport of any conception?
What is the rational purport of the conception of the market in Marx's terminology?
When people speak of Marxist praxis, they might ignore that it is potentially capitalist.
I am in God's universe when I name his animals.
I am in the industrial/capitalist era when I name the material conditions which transcend national borders.
There is no breaking free.
It's just as stupid as breaking free from God's cosmos by a Tower of Babel.
Man invented the Tower of Babel.
Either some man, for freedom, conspired against the others to undermine it, blaming it on God.
This man would be a Prometheus.
Another man decided to obscure the lack of freedom by blanketing all men under the same fragile mis-interpretation of the world.
This man would be a Jesus Christ.
Another man wants to ensure that nothing can be built vertically, wants to ensure that there will always be need of bridges, interpreters.
This man would be a Kojima, or a Skull Face.
To want bridges, though, is not to contest the verticality.
It is not to fight upwards.
It is to build horizontally, with arches.
The Parthenon, l'Arc de Triomphe, etc.
Also of note is Ayn Rand's Fountainhead.
We have to know how to build horizontally as well as vertically.
Things may stack -- but an arch does not stack.
An arch is a harmonic, musical building.
A skyscraper oscillates harmonically.
These general laws must pervade our construction.
We are pitched by our well dug-in language. Reference:

# Geoffrey Hill's "Dialogue: For Stanley Rosen" in Without Title, page 499
1.
As to whether there persists--enlighten me--
a dialectic: labour into desire.
Forgive my small vocabulary that tries
and abides your patience. What a wonder's
man the philosopher set on his throne.
What a wonder he is, and how
abysmal. I would not have you say
I speak ungratefully; or that there's self
going spare in our unsparing tribute.
*Arbeitsknecht* by adoption, I never
hurl down advice, even to shake the building.
Perhaps (but not likely) I may be still
a whizz at ordinary language and you
mishear things.

No, put it this way: cancel, expunge, annul,
self-reference. Philosophy keeps up
embarrassment and expense. I'd quit us
of further scars had these now been incurred.
You're magisterial in judgmenet's gorge
where the rocks are at all angles and the stream
huggers its way through:
let's flip with self-projection's paper boat.
Language not revealing to the elect
only; and wild descenders pierced by good.
So few of us absolved when what we write
sets us to rights on some false scale of justice.
You're magisterial in your own conviction.
And a clown with it, and a judge of clowns.
3. Susurrations of winter: voicing stems mistune
a glass harmonica at my good ear.
The alien's close to home, the changeling's not too much a prodigy or wastrel; lovers
and children not inimical by rote.
Something here even so. Our well dug-in
language pitches us as it finds--
I tell myself
don't wreck a good phrase simply to boost sense--
granted its dark places, the fabled burden;
its loops and extraordinary progressions;
its mere conundrums forms and rites of discourse;
its bleak littoral swept by bursts of sunlight;
its earthen genius auditing the spheres.




Theory provides cognitive structures in language.
To conquer is to provide language and prevent language.
To know is to form words; knowing is recollection, recall, repetition, the creation of simulacra for phantasms.
Hauntology?
But mastering:
God gives Adam the task of naming the animals.
This is man's self-actualization in the cosmos God has defined.
I recognize by means of schemas.
The schema for dog suffers from wordlessness.
Plato's joke which goes over Pascal's head: "Man is a featherless biped."
We know that the use of these words to define man is useless.
So Pascal is touching upon the problem of the Kantian schema.
How is it possible for me to take a few particular dogs, my memories of them, etc.
and to invest them all into the idea of a dog, such that, whatever species of dog surprises me,
I am not surprised by its being a dog?
I should read more of section 2 in Eco's "Kant and the Platypus" for more on this.
There is an which by means of a schema can be generally constructed:
*I can now recognize any dog* 
Word-formation for recognizing the manipulated concept.

The rational purport of the conception is its corresponding behavior.
I behave rationally when I act with respect to a conception.
Man simply does infer.
There is the psychological reality, and the transcendental reality of a cogititating self which is enframed.
The psychological reality is what is in the frame.
The transcendental eludes one partially, but, the fundamental fact is the fact of difference. (Derrida, Voice & Phenomenon)


Physics or other objective sciences which teach principles yield the conceptions of the world which are least often wrong.
Conceptions formulated as statistical hypotheses can also be tested by the remarkable characters of data,
 and rules derived in the face of uncertainty, as long as the individual knows that the provisional rule of conduct
 set with respect to this conception/hypothesis (What's the meaning of Newton's *hypotheses non fingo*?)
When you conceive
