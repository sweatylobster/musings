# Ground Zeroes

Dogs in the form of a V. The Marines in the prison are with Cipher. The marine that has the classified intel of the black site expansion project is present -- his face is made explicit. He's left behind to ensure that Big Boss is deceived by the inside agent.


# Glaz and Palitz
Glaz is Kaz,
Palitz is Big Boss.

Palitz coughs. Does Glaz cough?
Palitz experiences the phantom pain with words, but Glaz perhaps does not.

Venom Snake loses his whole arm, not just the trigger finger. Venom Snake feels the phantom pain in his fingertips, the greatest extension, or boundary of the lost limb.
If the analogy of the phantom pain is to be applied to language, then what is the limit of the word?

Those infected with the vocal cord parasites, who begin to speak the language that the parasites are attuned to, do not develop symptoms in the throat, the sinuses, or the esophagus, but in the lungs.
The lungs swell with the children of the parasite and kill the host. The vocal cord parasites are a false parasite because they kill their host. They do not live *through* the host, and do not have a guaranteed life-cycle as is accomplished in the Quarantine Facility.
