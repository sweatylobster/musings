I've been making so much progress as of late. 2024-01-06 19:46
Simple things bring it up.
The delay in others coming to find what I did as remarkable.
Just in general.
Comprehensive view of the laws undergirding our compensation.

Was thinking of the Fountainhead while watching a George Hotz video on accelerationism.

Head hurts, not sure why.
Maybe overworked.
Dispirited from being curved or ignored, but I'm so beyond that.
As far as aitiai go, why would my thumos be affected? 
Because I let it, of course.
My thumos, my spirit and breath, are always under my control.
In another sense, I'm not at all over it.
Haven't practiced going out *anyway*.
Tonight seems a good night to do.
Fracasar unas cuantas veces.

I mean line 5 only legally, but now I see I'm ignorant of it spiritually.
Wondering how much atonement's required.
Any at all would help, really.
Probably apologize to Alexis, Kristen.
But what good would that do more than harm.
Despicable and involuntary disdain y desprecio pour les femmes.
