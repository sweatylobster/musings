# 2022 has started
I am aging. I corrected my deterioration today by working out harder than I have in months. No big deal. It's standard, anyway. 

Reading is not difficult -- it's that my soul craves purpose. 

# The direction I want to go
In general, I want to create value for the economy. This necessitates that I be hardened against failure, and welcome failure, so that I can create *greater* value after I inevitably fail. Or will I quit?

I want to contribute significant value to human lives. I think entertaining, clever-subtle art with a life-affirming moral (Nights of Cabiria) is something I want to produce. Dad and I wrote TMC already, but he can't produce it. He's too busy. I don't know anything about production, so I can't solve the problem. We *need* other producers that we can trust.


I also want to write. I don't care if my family won't read -- others do, and will. I have written good essays this past year. I can publish them on Medium, for now, but that feels like whoring myself. Another plan is to publish them myself. I got an image of me selling the book as stapled-together 8.5x11" papers. 




While I can give value to the world through working as an ML engineer, I mostly want to learn the principles of ML to solve my own business problems. Why hire people if they're costly, inflexible, error-prone, and difficult to correct? People should not be performing logistical duties. For example, Johnny Locarni's monthly report generation is machine-replaceable, because it's schematized. A script can generate the reports he manually assembles in Excel every month. Meadow outputs 'simple data' (str, float, int, bool, etc.), which can be input directly into Python. I don't know what other value he provides for the company, but...

Now there's an idea! Apprentice under him! If not, I can still find a way to get the credentials I need to download reports. It's worth doing, to learn about ways to apply ML models to financial data -- to solve business problems. (I owe them nothing, so I'm free to work as I want -- and am acquainted with inner structure/workings, so I can draw causal lines between operators (Ali's overzealous purchases) and data (bad ROI).)

How does the understanding function? 

How do I solve problems optimally?
 - minimize time | memory
 - I need to classify solutions, their drawbacks

How will studying mathematics help me accomplish:
generating a scheme for 
 - classifying problems
 - fitting algorithms to them
 - generating solutions that minimize/maximize a variable output

This really seems like learning algorithms. An algorithm seems to be a strategy, or implemented rule, that operates on input(s) to produce one output. Like a sort alg.-- it'll take multiple inputs, compare them with some strategy, arrange them by some strategy. Not all sort algorithms are as fast as each other, but some use less memory. These two are the costs.
So algorithms solve problems (that they are adapted to solve).

So I clearly am most inspired by making art. I have potential as a director, because I love the psyche.
Then, because I am interested in logistics, I want to master the 'design patterns'/schemas which solve problems of a certain recognizable form. (This is a classification problem, and we have x samples, so we should use y model. Then, because our input data are 'unstructured'
