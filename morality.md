It's interesting that many people spend their lives pondering the simple reality that morale and pain/pleasure are unique. Cogency of purpose, control over morale are in no way related to the for-granted justification of suffering. That speech-time is used to justify suffering and give it meaning, infuse it with meaning... somewhat silly. Morale is a physiological reality not solely governed by the phantasms which speech can produce, nor the ideological beliefs which derive from such phantasms.

What meaning does bad morale have? ("What meaning does it not have?" Does this mean what meaning it excludes? I think of Godel naively.)
