# Programming roadmap July 2022 -> December 2022

------Orientation|Situation------
Where am I as far as programming goes? 
I know Python decently well. How do I improve? 
1. Define what I need Python for.
 - Machine learning
 - OCR apps
 - CV/robotics apps
 - Server/backend
2. Read books, or code for problems I share with others. 
 - Exposure to pythonic stuff, clever tools like functools.reduce(function, iterable) 
There are also features like decorators that make developer's lives easier;
I can learn these in the same way -- by reading/interpreting code.
I can hunt for these features by asking Twitter, Reddit, "What is everyone grateful for? What makes developers' lives easier?" 
Answering these questions should get me the edge of the particular programming language, like Python or JS.

What are the strengths of each of the programming languages I'm going to learn? Right now, I'm learning Python and JS.
Now that I'm learning JS, I have to ask what role Python's going to play in the apps I'm going to make.
The strength of Python is that it's readable. 
Execution speed can be improved with pypy. 
But the problem is the apacheDjango, Flask are some solutions to the problem which has a general form, that I don't really know. 

These are features specific to 
As far as having skills, though, I need to be able to solve the typical programming problems on HackerRank 
At this point, I'd grow most as a developer by getting the theory down of:
design patterns, algorithms, and the workflows facilitated by libraries like:
[numpy, pandas, seaborn, sklearn, keras]

## Python
I see the Python ecosystem being split into 
Some design principles that make sense to me are:
 - Use typical `for` loops instead of nutty one-liners. ("Readability counts.")
 - List comprehensions are slow at scale.
 - Be gentle with web requests. If using a tool like `wget`, use `-limit-rate=200k`, or the like. TODO: get the equivalent in requests.

I can use list comprehensions, generators, built-in types, make classes and define methods, and build simple functions. 



DataCamp has exposed me to the following libraries.
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

The libraries are APIs which offer transform input -> output in a convenient, intelligible fashion.
The functions they have implemented are functions commonly used in data science workflows. 
In the case of scikit-learn, inference models are classes. 
Methods are functions commonly The classifiers, which are an instance of the algorithm being applied to a data set, tuned on certain hyperparameters. 
The useful for statistics, data exploration, and inference.
