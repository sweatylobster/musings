Goal: Planning a month's action with a day.

Routines have ends.
Aim for the most distant point in the future--beyond what mortals can experience. We know starting from the future is the right direction because nobody can plan a day by the seconds. All aims allot actions to time by divisions of the determined time.
Conditional tasks act on the environment as if cued by it.
Periodic tasks are the same each time. Periodic tasks may be conditional. 
Eventually, a method makes the two indistinguishable. 



# Determine:
- how many tasks
- needs fulfilled 
- periods of practice (identify the mean, define both excess and lack)
