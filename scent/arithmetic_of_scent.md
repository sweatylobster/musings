# The problem with reproduction via units in general

All I'm working with is the recognition of the following.
The origin of dualism is Descartes's interpretation of senses, based on a "phenomenology of dreams".
The body and the mind (esprit) are the two obvious components of dualism.
Husserl in Section ??? of "The Crisis of the European Sciences" traces the development of the Cartesian idea of dualism to Galileo's radical conception of nature as inherently mathematical -- as having mathematical being.
Recall the section where Hobbes takes up Galileo's "subjectivist" 
We have to track the development of the word 'esprit' in Baudelaire for a full analysis of how he offers a meaningful alternative to the Cartesian account of knowledge and sensation.
Baudelaire would give us not a science, but would emend epistemology.
How it is that we come to know -- not a terminological restriction of the meaning of the word "savoir."

Le corps et l'esprit (body and mind) sont les deux parties de le dualisme.
The basis for the Cartesian mistrust in the senses is that *they* do not always report what is real. 
I can be surprised that "it was all just a dream."
But which senses are accomplice to this deception?
Certainly [not scent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwz8JprPeMc&t=3280s).
All I want to point to with the above is that the percept of the scent came from an object which was actually present. 
Because it is impossible for me to reconstruct the scent of my lover, I am not convinced that it is possible for me to conjure up her scent in a dream. I can hardly do so when waking.
So this is an account as to why geometry is available at all.
If it were not possible for us to be deceived by apparitions and voices in dreams, it would not be possible for us to reproduce them with stunning mathematical precision in waking life.

Dualism is a phenomenology.
(Dougherty's parody of Descartes's moral maxim.)
Descartes's mistaken phenomenology ignores the nature of scent.
Baudelaire Fleurs du Mal gives the possibility of a true phenomenology.
Baudelaire offers a meaningful movement far beyond dualism.
What did he do?
Why? There is __ in the sense which cannot be reproduced in dreams.
--- Baudelaire's odors--


Descartes's reorientation of philosophy, on the basis of the clear and distinct criterion, follows from his interpretation of the senses as unreliable after his rude awakening from a dream.
He's convinced he's somewhere, awakens and realizes he was never there.

For Baudelaire, scent transports us while we are awake and lucid.
The genius of:
[Correspondances, Une Charogne, Parfum Exotique]
is not the inaccessible, inscrutable symbolic genius of the sleeping mind, which arranges the dream for the self/ego/mind.
It is of an entertained creator/poet,"prince des nuees qui se rit de l'archer."


We can conjure up visual or acoustic phantasms at will with language, or experience them as reality in dreams. 
Geometry can reproduce any real object with exact precision by means of Cartesian coordinates. 
But prior to this invention, it was capable of anticipating any object in general.
We cannot do the same with scent.
No matter how many times I familiarize myself with the smell of a white rose, I will not be able to reproduce its smell in my head.
Not so with middle C, 440Hz, or a melodic phrase.
I choose this 
It is what is not in the room while we dream will not enter as a percept 



How do mathematical objects stand in relation to sensory phenomena?
In what sense can a mathematical description of sensory phenomena capture it?
It's really good at anticipation/reproduction of the phenomenon.
Weapon schematics, blueprints, specifications, building plans, physics equations, etc. -- all anticipate something that'll show up in the world.


A very vague question without clues, so here are some.
Let's talk plainly about ideal and real.
It's kind of stupid to say "a circle doesn't exist in the real world, because they're all imperfect."
I swear I've seen perfect circles; I wasn't able to tell them apart from perfect ones.
But obviously, I'm comparing them to the ideal object that I have in my head.
This is the object that the worldly circle is recognized to be.
The circle's more complicated than the triangle, though.
For me to *represent* a triangle, I represent a particular triangle that *belongs to a class*. (Insert Berkeley quote)
That is, unlike the circle, whose only variable is the radius, the triangle 

## The strategy of a perfect investigation

The perfect form of this paper compares the different senses as they 'relate/lead to/suggest/are comprehended by' to mathematical concepts. 
That's a bit complicated for the moment.
Right now, I need to talk about the difficulty of mathematizing scent.
We have to ask whether a geometry of scent is possible.
If it is not, the mathematics of scent is only possible by a formal mathematical language which uses symbols, signs.
In short, a logistice speciosa.


Why the indecision? It's difficult to say, in general, how the mathematical concept relates to the sensory phenomenon.
Let's take the notion of ratio.
It's a concept elicited both by the eyes and ears (a Pythagorean idea).
For this reason, when the Pythagoreans say that the 

While harmonies do make us think of ratios, or intervals (octaves, perfect fifth, tritone, major 7th, etc.) visual ratios take more time to recognize.
The ear recognizes ratios in a moment, whereas the eye must analyze and measure the objects to become aware the particular ratio.




## Where does the sentence below belong?
For example, Dedekind broke continuity's reliance on the geometrical intuition for its 'proof'. [^1]


## The tradition; scientific reproduction of scent; are smells capable of arithmetical representation?

saber; to know | to taste.

For us to investigate what it means to recognize something, we must acknowledge that there are many analogies with scent.
Girlfriends can reliably pick out their boyfriends' 


The sense of scent is essential for recognition of objects.
To date, there are no units that describe scents.
We cannot quantify musk, in terms of basic units.
Perhaps we can describe it in a kind of Fourier series of smaller signals -- but this would take place after the scent is transduced by the olfactory bulb.
This means that scent, in and of itself,
The use of units is essential for consistent reproduction of objects and sensory phenomena.

If one wanted to synthesize a scent, which is not the question at hand, but is somewhat related to the capacity to reproduce with or without units
For example, a trombone's timbre can be captured via a mathematical function which regulates the construction of .
While it's possible to reproduce visual and acoustic phenomena by giving them an appropriate arithmetical representation
This is important because AI receives a representation of the world via number.
This means that AI can conceive of the cosmos exactly, and in no more sophisticated a manner than the Pythagoreans.[^2] (Read Klein again, cazzo)
How exactly are perfumes reproduced?
All we need are ratios of certain scents which might reach certain concentrations.
Still, we're not saying that musk is describable in terms of certain units.
The color red, however, is describable as the 440nm wavelength of light.



Furthermore, geometry makes sense only in a 'visual' sense.
Blind men are in principle able to follow along with the Euclid audiobook.
So 'visual' doesn't simply mean observed by the eyes.
Still, the schema is interchangeable with the mental image/phantasm, because it's general and not particular.
This is the sense that eidos has, as well. It is not a particular image, but a general form for like images.

Big question: is there 







FOOTNOTES
[^1]: Dedekind's Theory of Numbers secured a scientific foundation for infinitesimal analysis. Newton's 'ultimate ratio', a relation of equality between two differing quantities, which obtains in an ultimate case, is illustrated by the notion of 'magnitude'. 

Leibniz, somewhere or other, used conic sections, and in particular, a hyperbola to establish the notion of continuity. (TO PROVE) Although Leibniz did secure the notion with a geometrical proof, Dedekind's reservations about the scientific status of continuity 

is possible without depending on postulates

of the notion of continuity. by providing an arithmetical basis for its crucial notion of continuity. by showing that continuity, the principle on which the differential calculus is founded, does not require geometrical intuition for its proof. In fact, the reliance on the geometrical intuition to furnish a proof of continuity (in turn proving the validity of the differential calculus) is the very problem Dedekind overcomes by giving continuity a purely arithmetical definition. And before I go on to elaborate on what Dedekind accomplished, I should qualify that we are talking about noeta, or mental *things* (Wittgenstein's "Dinge").
The Schnitt is a term whose rational purport is to divide the countables (be they rationals, irrationals, etc.) into two classes, those higher, and those lower. While the visual intuition assists us in determining which countables are higher, which lower at a summary glance, the meaning of the word Schnitt does not necessitate that .
