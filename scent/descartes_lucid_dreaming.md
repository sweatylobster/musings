# Cartesian doubt applied to a geometrical analogy

Let's say someone doubts the generality of a geometrical proposition.
This is not because we doubt the axioms, which means this is not a lack of faith in the validity of deduction.
Rather they doubt that the proposition, accomplished through this particular triangle, works for any and all triangles.

That is, we have a schema, or diagram, accompanying the logos, or argument of the proposition.
The schema represents the success of the proposition in a particular case (whatever).
But let's say the skeptic reads the phrase *a particular case whatever* as *this particular case.*

If we'd like to convince this skeptic, we could not use another particular triangle.
For then, they would have two particular cases, and no general case.
But does a skeptic like this exist?
The mind simply does not inhere in this Zeno's paradox of infinitely varying representations,
always exhausting the domain of particulars contained under the general concept.
Achilles wins the race; the mind gets the gist.

But this skepticism applied to the what Descartes has done with the senses, as far as their ability to present to us the truth.
Descartes makes a fuss out of dreams in a remarkable way.

We would then miss the meaning of the schema.
There is, however, a phenomenological quandary here:
How is the schema any and all possible representations?

Surely, Kant takes advantage of this fact in his terminology, but does he give an account?
I really have to read schemas, since that's where I stopped. 

In any case, continuing with the present argument:
We could then test the proposition 

## The foundation of the doubt of senses ignores the persistence of the mind even in dreams

The possibility of lucid dreaming
The fact that the ego persists in dreams, fantasies, and waking life
**: or transcendental unity of apperception(?) one must closely read the terms as they appear in FREUD & KANT
