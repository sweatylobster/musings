# Future technique of programming

For artificial intelligence to develop, so too must statistics develop.
Any algorithm is a formal structure which looks at how reality stands in posing an answer to a question.
Questions are answered because sensation, or aesthetics, provide us with questions.
The imagination does not solve these questions.
Questions do not exist in the  of number
We are developing algorithms, models, and computational means of representing aesthetically relevant identities.
