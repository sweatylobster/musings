# What am I going to use python for?

Python's my first programming language -- the one I understand best.
I can usually look at code and visualize the objects returned, what they do, what their methods are.
I'll do these in Python:
File manipulation, data cleaning and management with pandas.
Matrix operations with numpy, subsetting, etc. Random number generation for bootstrapping.
Statistical functions with scipy.stats.
Machine learning algorithms with sklearn.

## Which work routines do I see myself using python for?

Statistical work with scipy.stats, seaborn
Get statistics on our income, its sources.
Design statistical experiments to determine lucrative practices.
Do data-visualization to intuit patterns and rules to help employees.

Get data from APIs with the requests library.
Automat website archiving with requests, bs4, wget, selenium.
Automat javascript apps with selenium. (But just write better apps *in* javascript.)
Extract text data from images with OCR and regex (paddleocr and re)
Process templated forms (train a KIE model with paddleocr)


- webscraping:                         selenium
- regexing:                            re
- cleaning data:                       recordlinkage, pandas, numpy
- statistical experiments, hypotheses: scipy.stats, numpy
- OCR:                                 paddleocr, easyocr

### Which Python language features am I not using? Explain what it does and how you would use it.

1. decorators
When a function's decorated, it executes in the line sequence specified by the wrapper function. 
I'd use it with contingent steps; e.g. encrypt/decrypt a string *before* passing it somewhere else. 
2. classes
Classes allow me to create objects with common properties that can be aware of other objects.
They can implement methods like:
__add__, __mul__, __repr__, __doc__, __set__, __get__, etc.
These can be used to grant meaningful, custom, unique behaviors between the objects.
__add__ might be used to do combat, for example, for D&D characters and enemies.
On the other hand, you could define a custom method.
3. built-ins *filter*, map, functools.reduce, max, min, a lot of the built-ins
numpy.vectorize

#### Which packages should I master to get a job in data science?

numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, statsmodels, scipy.stats

#### How would they improve the skill set I have to offer to a business?

Statistical analysis, data visualization and wrangling, automation.

- Descriptive statistics 
- Product analysis
- Sales techniques
- Customer profiling
- Optimize employee efficiency with algorithms
- Statistical experiments for sales techniques
- NLP/statistical tests for copy and marketing.
