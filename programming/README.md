## Direction on programming

At this point, ignorance and pure curiosity cost me a great deal.
I need to hone my craft and increase my productivity.
My goals in life are to become a better musician, engineer, programmer, and artist.
I have an artistic perspective on programming.

## The programmer's tools

- text editor
- memory: language proficiency, familiarity with its concepts
- references (man, help, books, lsp, cht.sh, stackoverflow, reddit, discord, chatgpt, Github copilot, blogs, youtube)

My text editor is neovim.
Willing to spend weeks to configure it since it'll *reduce overhead* in coming years.
It would be awesome, too, if it *also* increases my productivity.
But the goal is reducing overhead and cost, since I'm just a first-year programmer for young languages.
I don't yet know what optimal means. But I do have a good sense for 'speedrunning'.
Get good at configuring, adapting, etc.

My memory applies only to Python. My scripting skills (bash, PowerShell) are mediocre/don't exist, really.
In all honesty, getting laid will help me to remember how to do things.
So, do that.

Which books do I own that I can refer to?
If I'd like to do scripting, PowerShell would be useful.
There will always be a Windows machine around.
If I'm planning on using UNIX stuff, or installing WSL, bash and zsh are really useful too.
I love Linux, prefer zsh tools, but apparently text causes problems.
I'm still noob, so idk.
