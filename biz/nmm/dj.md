# DJ for Dean Jackson
Make a money machine. Determine your living expenses for your ideal lifestyle a priori, and have it be a determined portion of your passive income. 

# How to make a money machine?
Cold call is labor with no leverage. Direct response marketing -- everybody knows what they're buying, and they want it! That's why they're calling you.

# Get rich or get famous
Meet people's needs, not your own. Personal promotion is costly! It's not getting your name out there -- it's getting their names in here. Get your prospect's name in your system. This is called direct response marketing. This is what relevant ads are -- know who those people are who would be interested in your products. Jay Abrahams: "serve the other."

# Build a business which has interchangeable parts
Freedom depends on the configuration where you don't have to serve with your personality. Create it so that you have the express intention of duplicating it -- franchise systems. Dean Jackson made the direct response marketing approach with a view to the franchise model. He licensed systems to other realtors. Once you create a logistical system which solves the problems of your own business in an assembly line fashion, you can license the system out. 

# View to the customer

The customer is not a tree in the forest -- the customer is *one person*. Yes, the customer can be classified -- this is what YouTube, Facebook, Amazon all do. In the case of Amazon, it is both the agora and the direct response, relevant marketer. Diversity of values must be addressed: convenient, rigorous, etc. Systematize meeting different criteria.

# View to the market

The current optimal object is not gonna stay on top. Be flexible with what the optimal objects of the market are. Prius over an SUV, now. When it comes to timing markets: Warren Buffet saying: "Be greedy when people are fearful, be fearful when people are greedy." Recognize the potential early, assess it, and be aggressive in taking it. Never be blinded by opportunities lost: there will be opportunities. Investing in penny stocks, for example, can provide returns in the 1000% range.

# How to get what you want
You're allowed to get what you want. Unconscious opens channels in line with desire. Be clear with what you want, don't settle. Be clear with the level of freedom that you want, and don't settle. Technology is your instrument to attain that. Desire organizes the technology. 

# The requirement of freedom
Do the work before you get the value. Take the risk that you're not gonna get the value returned. 

# Business has to address these three needs
Before - Build potential clientele (get the person whose needs you can satisfy)
During - Serve actual clientele
After  - Nurture lasting relationship, maintain trust (returns + referrals)

# Manage relationships for 20% annual yield (once in 5 years)
You already are the de facto server. If you nurture the bond you have with this person, it is likely, that over the next 5 years, that they will come to you again. Though the most expensive part is getting the customer it's very expensive to lose them. Don't expect your prospects to reach out to you again. 

# Example
"You're here at my house, I'm gonna go over there, feel free to go through my fridge." vs. "Yo man, I just made these cookies! Have one." Use politeness (that prevents refusal) to get a person to use your service again. We don't want to reject, or have anyone go out of their way. But if they did go out of their way, they won't reject. Personalize the contact. Make sure that there's a specific request that you can address. 

# Being demanding
"Hey, can you give me *all of this info?* I just really need it." Only hardasses will demand this, even though they want it. If I already have the resource, and then ask if you want it, it's really just a matter of adding you to the list. It's the cookies. 

# Before
Who are the individuals who really need this?
Joe's Bros gadgets and ganj:
1. The people who are depressed or lonely
2. The people who don't have 'time' or skill to roll weed
3. The people who want to impress their friends with their cool paraphernalia (social smokers)
How do I reach these people?
1. Through delivery services
2. At social events, through delivery services
3. At the sesh, at social events

# During
People want the end result. If I'm selling my house, I wanna get into my new house, stat. Sure, I'll choose someone who'll get me my house sold, but if someone gives me a check to get me into my new house, I'll go with them, even if the sale takes longer. The value I render is instrumental to *their* destination. What are the most predictable ways to get them to their destination? Systematize meeting their criteria. What is it that delivers beyond what a person expects to receive? (The cookies, for example.) If the other person is invested, prepared, have the idea of where they're gonna go, all you do is relax and state your needs. That's what makes me a raving fan. 

# After
Create a raving fan such that they:
1. Notice the conversations in which your service applies
2. Rave about your service
How do you enable this?
1. Monthly, bi-monthly newsletter. Focus on adding value to their life, in their new role. Ways to enjoy new role as past customer. Range Rover, Rolls Royce. 
2. Ask people to refer a specific client. Make a referral profile: these guys hang around in packs. This client has kids, who hang out with other kids, whose parents are looking for townhouses!

# Define success
Internal criteria:
Determine these *for us.* Start with the end in mind. 
I need to understand the misconceptions about marketing. Branding is very costly in time and resources. Direct response marketing will give me the greatest return for my time and effort. 
There's gotta be some place in this market where I can serve needs. New-time buyers? The guys who've gotta move?
Add value in tiny chunks, shuffle them through the Before, During, After incrementally in a way that makes them family. I have equity in relationship: that's the greatest equity I have.

How can I apply a classifier to optimize direct response marketing?
