# Adapting to the new world with new tools

Small businesses have an advantage in meeting people's needs. Make your website return more. 

# Problem
People don't need to be Atlas -- the entrepreneur is the contractor. The entrepreneur is the master of logistics. You don't have to be the person doing everything. 

# Get freelancers to establish the product
Everybody's hustling all around the world. Odesk, freelancer, upwork, elance, guru etc. Outsource everything. Websites and products were made almost instantly 

# Who to hire?
"Yo, I like this project, but honestly, I can't do it for this little." This person critically thought about it. To think as an entrepreneur: opportunity cost is big. This is the principle of Vim. This is why I gotta get hyrated. Hire the experts who love being competent and fast; they're trying to justify their own opportunity cost. 

1. Define product
2. Find customers
3. Make the offer incredible

# Be resourceful -- not the resource
Outsource people. "I can't afford you, but I'll make you a partner."

# Excuses
I didn't know how, who, what, etc. If you're creative enough, you will find the resources. Parents aren't gonna do everything for you -- they'll support, but you gotta make shit happen. Make your dreams happen. I still want to learn engineering -- I don't want to hire engineers. I want to design and speak the language. 

# Meta-marketing
Had fun making a potato gun, optimized, saw on Yahoo that 18k people search for potato guns. "People really just want the content." 
How to market the optimal potato gun? Website with an order button -- mail DVD. Made a rudimentary ad. Bought a banner ad on a potato gun forum.
"How are you making this money with these stupid ideas?" Make traffic for what people want. (Some number of) People will pay the asking price, even if you think it's ridiculous. 
Add the value, make the product.

# What's made you successful?
What kind of value can I provide for someone? Save time, make a system for creation. Optimize products. 

# Internet as a source
Information marketing. Don't be like anyone else. Be exciting. Give people the content that *is criteria.* "Indoctrinate, and you'll keep them forever."
Get people to use the same terminology, the same type of language -- this is "indoctrination." 
What's microcontinuity? 

# What do I need to do to start?
1. Get the specialists (if you aren't one, you know someone who is)
2. Someone is willing to pay for your specialized knowledge (Antonio $2500 to grow WHEN HE IS ALREADY GROWING, bc it'd be useful for Davide)
3. Where am I gonna find people that buy this?

I don't need to build the house, I can be the contractor. 
Who's my target market? Where do they congregate? (Formus, message boards) Come to the people that are already assembling other people/be a partner with people who've assembled a target market mailing list. Build an account for people to trust because of the affinity with their interest. Zero in on the customer. 

# Information marketing 
Get way higher increase of return, in a machine, than the cost. Value rendered is the knowledge which the client takes responsibility for mining out. Grandma and the Great Books curriculum. Me and the *scuffed* Finxter website. It was a good start. 
Why don't people make money with websites? "A confused mind always says no." KISS. "Squeeze pages, landing pages." One call of action. 

# Structure
Headline - dank secret that you can give out for free
Gimme - name and e-mail address
If you don't know who's landing, you can't squeeze. Give them something that they see potential in.
"The worst thing you can try to do is sell to people. People like buying stuff but not being sold to." 
"Free video, come check it out." Automate direct marketing -- make it personal. Share experiences. 
Genius of KDNuggets and Medium. Give value up front, and they'll want more. Plate of cookies. Add real value with these techniques. 

# What to do?
Give people free value. They have an ah-ha moment where they see the potential in your system. Refer them to your system while they're in peak buying state.
