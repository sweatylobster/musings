# Relationships
Trust as more important than money, because trust creates the relationships that allow you to exchange value. 

# What do you value?
Helping people to bring together the relationship-building technologies. LinkedIn, Facebook, etc. How to build trust over the internet?

# Why's it harder to connect with people over the internet?
People can do things IRL just fine. A lot of people aren't confident with the tools, and aren't comfortable with the aspect of virtual mediation. 

# How do you build trust?
Stop treating people arithmetically. Use the tools to read people's needs. 

# Who's on the web
1. Scammers
2. Inept nice ppl
3. Add valuers?
Is there real business here? Is connection moving my business?

# How to produce a real result with tools
Be clear with what you want for your business. Relentlessly pursue customer service; technology enables the customer to inform you. 

# How do you produce momentum with your business
Build a home-base, like a blog. Don't start on Twitter, Facebook, etc. -- these are outposts. Let them refer you to your homebase. Interact with people in comments. Build listening devices. 

# What are the problems that my business can solve?
"I'm gonna keep calling on you continuously, because someone at some time is gonna say yes. Either you in a different mood, or someone else in charge."

# How to gain trust
Refer to other people more than you refer to yourself. "Tell me about you." Grandpa mode.
