# I respect myself first
I respect myself first. For myself I am law; I am the city that I rule. If, as you utter these words, you feel that you're lying: Identify the voice in you whose respect you must earn: or no: the voice who *wills that you earn your own respect*. Be grateful that you do call yourself on your own shit -- you have the gift of self-regulation. 

# Healthy self-correction
Never mock yourself. Etymology of delusion. The only time other people laugh when someone's self-deprecating is when everybody else feels how ironic it is. Etymology of hipocrisy. If you feel that this is a hope, you know that it's not a reality. The voice telling you it's a hope wants you to make it a reality. Whether it believes in you or not is not the importance of its role -- it rightfully charges you with the responsibility over your habitation, and therefore, ability. It is not a "useful" voice, because admonition is not useful. What faith in your power, as a moral agent, does the voice unwaveringly affirm? How else would it be possible that the voice does inform you with the awareness of your distance from your ideal? While both of you know the distance, it will not permit its repression. If you repress this voice, it will return with an intensity and charge that it will force you, eventually, to take on. Acknowledge that you know how far you are from *your own* goal. Who's that voice that tells you about this distance? Is this the same voice that puts your dreams together?

# Steady morale: "Take extreme ownership."
When you make a mistake, grin with the dignity of ownership. Honor your will as a causal force, and your self as a moral agent. As Jocko Willinck makes it abundantly clear: never blame anybody else. "Take extreme ownership." You have the joy of aggressing (ad-gredi) your goal.  "grin and bear it." Do not suffer: it will make of you a weak, pathetic, patient. Don't whore your self out for the nobility of your animal response to suffering. Suffering is meaningless, it is your response to suffering which is your only meaning for it. To increase morale is necessarily ecological and political. Never take opposition personally -- not everybody wants to join the military. And for those who know it's a hell: why do they desire to return?

# Lift weights
When you start to fail, sustain your failure. Strength is nothing but the incorporation of weakness. Etymology of debility - de habitus. Ability: having a habit. Animals are able, in proportion with their habitat. When you become master of your law, you become ecologist: creator of your habitat. You are only the amount of energy which you demand from yourself. Man as an emergent pattern in the universe, a flux, a pattern of oscillation. 

# Know your place in the cosmos
Look at the stars like you were the first man to do so. Name them for yourself. Create a new constellation. Your law rules the heavens. In Genesis, God doesn't teach Adam the names of the animals: he tells Adam to name them himself.

# Permit yourself to refuse 'connecting' on the level of cliche
Cliche is awareness that language has meaning, separate from intention. Deception is delight in this awareness. Nihilism is to intepret no contradiction of this sort as remarkable, *valuable*. For those who use cliche, deception, or haplessness: they infer their power from circumstance. This is why it is imperative not to use or be subject to cliche -- be spontaneous. 

# The choice of Socrates
Be exiled, or be assassinated by the state, and make philosophy immortal. GGWP. Who lived longer: the gods of the city, or Socrates? Even God is dead.
