# Outline
- Anger and politics/games; it's prudent to be in control of anger
    - anger on the face is anger absent from the breath, the torso (this is the fulcrum of anger, concentrating it and displaying it)
- Essence of anger; most object-oriented passion (enraged bull)
- Relaxed tension
    - feigning rest with relaxation
- The internal benefits of anger (relaxing the face while feeling it)
    - Obsession with a point in space (weak point tracking, the sense of its motion)
    - Increased pressure in the torso (increased strength)
	- When anger is subordinate to rationality, it becomes 'emotional content.'
	    - This allows one to relax the body, which focuses delivery of energy, and optimizes reflexion (double-sense: Newton's 3rd, reading reflection) 
- The benefits of displaying anger: bluffing, deception (anger erupts on the face)
    - Bluffing with anger is useful if:
	- I know they're stronger than I am (and I can intimidate, or negotiate for a resource (space, usually) by my ferocity)
	    - Because I'm small and light (150 lbs), my whole-body momentum is how I have to gather most of my kinetic energy 
		- Run into the kick and prepare the explosive motion to be the triangle with the longest hypotenuse (Galileo's Vavg.* t  = Vfi) 
	- I have measures for the follow-up to their lure (bull gets nothing but cape? no -- matador gets nothing but air, then is gored while being extraverted)
- If they're stronger:
	- Always evade their superior strength
	- Read what makes them regain their composure (this is an opening if they are over-confident, an opportunity to deceive and then follow up if they are prepared)
	- Have measures to cripple their most reliable limbs
	- Use strategy and measures to make them:
	    - Doubt what they rely on
		- Strike unseen in the moment they begin processing doubt: don the mask of relaxation when gathering inertia, then explode (relaxed tension)
		    - You can't ever react to doubt -- you have to predict it and signal to them to strategize in what they perceive is the downtime
			- This is why feigning rest with one's relaxation
			- Doubt takes cognitive time: the attack has to accumulate its "inertia" with full obsession in this window
			- When you've made a read, fully commit your force to it (know that they are *actually* vulnerable and ignore the impulse to react)
			    - You can also do a bluff read for them to take advantage of your over-commitment
	    - Double down on what they rely on
		- This is one of the best opportunities for a final blow, since they are *not* thinking
	    - Make decisive blows in their transitions to what they rely on
		- Once they doubt, 
- If they're more clever:
	- to invite them to show me the red cape again, right now
    - to deceive
    - Deception is simply that I am angry at *this*, and therefore distracted from *that*
	- You can only make something of this tactic if you have measures against their opportunistic retaliations
		- Unless they are playing the same game as you, the most likely response is the most flattering to their cleverness:
		    - They will likely take the path of least resistance, to :
			- conserve energy
			- demonstrate the gap in your intelligences:
			    - "Even something *that* stupid worked!"
			    - "I *knew* something that stupid would work!"
			    - This has to be anticipated if they relish their own cleverness.
		- How do we know that they relish their cleverness?
		    - They're insecure about their intelligence, interrupt others, agree with anything decisive, etc.
		    - It is, just like masturbation in relation to sex, self-pleasure in direct compensation for lack of the good
			- They masturbate: Reflecting on data where one has been *more* clever, and in *this amount* (boasting makes it obvious that they masturbate)
				- which just like in relation to sex, is fantasy because the good (or at least what's better) is not in our possession
				- This is delusion (diversion mel√© avec un amusement mortel)
	    - Have measures for all of their follow-ups, then dissolve into calmness as your anger finds the anticipated object. 
		- Simply catching them off-guard to formulate a plan in that moment, or simply make them is cause for a reversal
		    - Have a measure for what they will do when embarrassed


# Anger ; emotional content ; freedom ; self-mastery
Anger is the fulcrum of the soul. 
Let others make you angry and you alienate the benefit of your anger. 
Obviously, it is true you are controlled by anger.
(As by any other passion!)
To defend against the force of this truth is ironic;
To resist it is to try to be 'free' the wrong way, since we can't defy nature.
(Is it being free, or is it being dominant?)
(I think about relativity: the revision to Maxwell's 3rd equation, Huygens's boats, + balls,)
The principle of relativity applied to a fight: there is always only one center to a fight.
Therefore with the internal fight -- there's already the victory decided at the center of it.
If the weight of reason oppresses you -- yield! Get out of the way!
Why be stubborn against a bull?
The only way to defeat the bull is to make it more stubborn than you.
And so with any overwhelming force: make it more stubborn than you.
But anger is a unique passion in that it always has an object.
It is maybe the most object-oriented passion.
Its extreme focus is blinding, but this is exactly its power: the commitment to its object.
This means that anger has to enter only in moments, and never be an obsession.
Surgical fury.

Therefore, to remain free, you must be the *only* one in control of your anger,
lest you vainly conquer the wrong object.
You can't afford to alienate your anger: you have to control its intensity, its object, and what event occasions it.
(Try not to laugh when you Whip the river)
That is -- don't be taunted. Having good humor is being politically savant, dangerous since self-mastered. 
If not dangerous, at least not truly dismissible. 
Self-mastery is to secure the best bluff with ease: you've still got something up your sleeve.
Another bluff is to use irascibility to show that you don't have self-control. 
Making something of your foe's perception of this takes good timing, however.
What is it that they would do that would be to your advantage?
Lack of preparation for *this* (whatever the *this* is gonna be in that case). 


Anger is my nature.
But to be free is never to be contrary to nature, nor to contradict nature,
nor to yield to nature, nor to be as nature.
To be free is to be the diagonal.
I am contained in nature,
but the "me" is irrational to it.
The two ways to halve a square are drawing
the common base of now two triangles,
or the common side of now two rectangles.
Though I don't know how to name it,
there's something beautiful in that we can make two symmetrical halves of a square
using triangles (sooner) instead of rectangles (later).


# Ecological-economic relations

Substitute the client-server relation for a site-fixed (ecological) relation
Former comes about through private property.
site as private property
ridiculous, obviously
especially to those who have any religious or spiritual attachments to sites!
The potential for a site to be religious is entirely based off of it not being private! Holiness deprives nothing, restricts nothing... the ascetics are not holy by deprivation, starvation, restriction... they are holy by focus, practice, intention -- anger.
e.g. the economic relation between 'two individuals using a factory'
not a very catchy movie title, mais...
Let's say instead of having a lessor-lessee relationship,
the two have a relationship of maintaining the site.
This would be a relation of equality.
It may be political insofar as ecology is given a political status,
but it is not necessarily political, since there is not a view to private property.
The former is 
where the one who owns the factory is compensated at a price he specifies,
unless the other bargains it down,
if someone pays for maintenance of the machines 
in proportion to the wear-and-tear sustained
for  the day leased
