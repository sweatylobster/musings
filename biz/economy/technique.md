# The worker has not been understood

To the day -- we still do not understand man as a tool. Man is supposed to subscribe himself to any given service, without an understanding of the ends he manifests. This is the problem, not with capitalism, but with something far prior to capitalism. Surely, capitalism leverages the ability for man to alienate his labor, by the fact that labor is in itself gratifying and *meaningful*. If it's as Viktor Frankl says -- and I am ignorant of negative anywhere near as forceful (and still the force of faith would be a mystery) -- that man *needs* a why to live -- this is a result of man having developed beyond rote repitition of survivalist actions. We have developed into a biological entity beyond survival. Meaning seems to have developed out of pleasure. This is why drug addiction is a problem. Drug addiction is a philosophical problem. Nihilism is not deriving pleasure from meaning. This is not it's root, but it's a fundamental feature that is useful in simplifying the problem of nihilism to be politically manageable. The question of how to politically address nihilism is the real problem I want to face. 

But because men are free, and their reason is subordinated to their passions (No.11, Madison?), they'll be not just capable of erring, but they'll be determined to err. This isn't a conscious fixation, or a neurotic, spiteful obsession with being weak and nihilistic -- it's the consequence of moralizing against force -- making *the possession of force* a matter of conscience. Possessing strength is not just evil; the conscience (and this is more crafty and nefarious than a schlechtig / plain conscience) of the resentful, aided by amour-propre . 

Really, the problem is a moralization against force.

Quantum of force -- damned to be weak. One can only leave weakness by agony. Purification, rapture -- by calories.

# Luxury as a distraction of the problem of meaning.

Very self explanatory. The Republic deals with this in Book IV -- the possibility of justice (whether it is possible/willable 'into being') depends on acting in moderation, which is already the mark of a rational being knowing how much is excess. I know *in respect of which goal* my actions [fall short of | exceed] the mark.


# Neither does the worker understand the one envisioning

What is the consequence of dreaming only of luxury? Immoderation, and therefore, the impossibility of justice. The money-making life is not by itself a life of justice, but what just man is poor? One can be fair only with what one has. Beggars cannot be fair. Some portion of the rich, too, are miserly. Workers who don't dream of generating value can't understand the owners, fair or unfair as they may be, which do generate value. All value is a dream which is transferred into its real equivalent.
